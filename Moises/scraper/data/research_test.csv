A compendium answering 150 questions on COVID‐19 and SARS‐CoV‐2,"AbstractIn December 2019, China reported the first cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has developed into a pandemic. To date, it has resulted in ~9 million confirmed cases and caused almost 500 000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID‐19 pandemic is the gravest health and socioeconomic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence‐based medical advice on SARS‐CoV‐2 and COVID‐19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self‐limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID‐19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a “cytokine storm” leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thromboembolic complications, and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID‐19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID‐19–related topics should be based on more coordinated high‐quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS‐CoV‐2, COVID‐19, and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development, and epidemiology. A total of 150 questions were answered by experts in the field providing a comprehensive and practical overview of COVID‐19 and allergic disease.Keywords: allergy, coronavirus disease 2019, COVID‐19, SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus 2","[<div class=""tsec sec"" id=""all14449-sec-0001""><h2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""all14449-sec-0001title"">1. INTRODUCTION</h2><p class=""p p-first"">The first cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), were reported in China in December 2019<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0001"" rid=""all14449-bib-0001"">

</p><p class=""p p-last"">The COVID‐19 pandemic is the world's gravest public health crisis of the 21st century, and there is an urgent need for reliable and updated scientific and clinical information. COVID‐19 is a zoonosis that has now spread worldwide, and it will be practically impossible to eradicate the SARS‐CoV‐2 without vaccination. The main question will be to learn how to cope with this virus, as COVID‐19 is becoming an important reason for morbidity and mortality in many countries. The aim of this paper was to provide short answers to pressing questions on virology, immunology, diagnostics, epidemiology, and treatment, as well as optimal management of allergic diseases during the COVID‐19 pandemic. These 150 answers are provided by a group of expert scientists and physicians, mainly from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), and are grouped in 9 sections. All the information will be updated in light of new upcoming evidence.</p></div>, <div class=""tsec sec"" id=""all14449-sec-0002""><h2 class=""head no_bottom_margin"" id=""all14449-sec-0002title"">2. SECTION 1: SARS‐COV‐2 VIROLOGY</h2><div class=""sec sec-first"" id=""all14449-sec-0003""><h3 id=""all14449-sec-0003title"">2.1. What is known about the origin of SARS‐CoV‐2?</h3><p class=""p p-first"">The coronavirus family has caused zoonotic diseases such the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While a direct ancestor of SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown, it is closely related to β‐coronaviruses in bats and pangolins, which are likely its original reservoir. SARS‐CoV‐2 could have risen by selection in the animal host followed by zoonotic transfer and acquisition of further mutations in humans. It is possible that, during undetected human‐to‐human transmission, the virus mutated, optimizing the binding of its spike protein to human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Figure <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_all14449-fig-0001"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/figure/all14449-fig-0001/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-fig-0001"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-fig-0001"" target=""figure""><span>1</span></a>).

Attachment of SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (S) to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates endocytosis of the virus into the host cell. The cell entry of the virus depends on both the binding of viral S proteins to cellular receptors and priming S protein by the transmembrane protease,serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Cepharanthine/ human recombinant ACE2 and camostat mesylate are the viral entry inhibitors, which prevent the binding of S protein to ACE2 and priming, respectively. In the uncoating stage, virions are internalized by receptor‐mediated endocytosis that the low pH in the endosome triggers the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and the single strand RNA is released into the cytoplasm. Arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and mefloquine block this uncoating stage. Transcription of the viral genome and proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyprotein and resulting translating proteins are processed into the viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir prevent proteolysis and activity of RdRp. Nonstructural and structural proteins, including nucleocapsid proteins are expressed as subgenomic RNAs. Selamectin and resveratrol may inhibit viral helicase activity, viral mRNA synthesis, and the expression of nucleocapsid proteins. Assembly and budding of viral proteins and nucleocapsid occur at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER‐Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and/or the Golgi complex. New SARS‐CoV‐2 virions are released by exocytosis</p></div></div></div></div><div class=""sec"" id=""all14449-sec-0004""><h3 id=""all14449-sec-0004title"">2.2.

What is known about the origin of SARS‐CoV‐2?</h3><p class=""p p-first"">The coronavirus family has caused zoonotic diseases such the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While a direct ancestor of SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown, it is closely related to β‐coronaviruses in bats and pangolins, which are likely its original reservoir. SARS‐CoV‐2 could have risen by selection in the animal host followed by zoonotic transfer and acquisition of further mutations in humans. It is possible that, during undetected human‐to‐human transmission, the virus mutated, optimizing the binding of its spike protein to human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Figure <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_all14449-fig-0001"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/figure/all14449-fig-0001/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-fig-0001"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-fig-0001"" target=""figure""><span>1</span></a>).

Attachment of SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (S) to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates endocytosis of the virus into the host cell. The cell entry of the virus depends on both the binding of viral S proteins to cellular receptors and priming S protein by the transmembrane protease,serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Cepharanthine/ human recombinant ACE2 and camostat mesylate are the viral entry inhibitors, which prevent the binding of S protein to ACE2 and priming, respectively. In the uncoating stage, virions are internalized by receptor‐mediated endocytosis that the low pH in the endosome triggers the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and the single strand RNA is released into the cytoplasm. Arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and mefloquine block this uncoating stage. Transcription of the viral genome and proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyprotein and resulting translating proteins are processed into the viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir prevent proteolysis and activity of RdRp. Nonstructural and structural proteins, including nucleocapsid proteins are expressed as subgenomic RNAs. Selamectin and resveratrol may inhibit viral helicase activity, viral mRNA synthesis, and the expression of nucleocapsid proteins. Assembly and budding of viral proteins and nucleocapsid occur at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER‐Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and/or the Golgi complex.

International primary immunodeficiency monitoring is being carried out, and few cases have been documented.

What is the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID‐19? </h4><p class=""p p-first-last"">ARDS is an acute life‐threatening inflammation of the lung due to infection, trauma, or inflammatory conditions. Excessive inflammation leads to alveolar damage and increased permeability of endothelial and epithelial cells. This results in protein‐rich fluid accumulation in the interstitium and the air space, which causes impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia. Reactive oxygen species, leukocyte proteases, chemokines, and cytokines also contribute to lung injury. The barrier impairment of the lung microvascular barrier is central to the pathogenesis of ARDS.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0092"" rid=""all14449-bib-0092"">
<sup>92</sup>
</a> Pulmonary vascular endothelial injury in association with the presence of the intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes contributes to the increase in endothelial permeability. COVID‐19 patients with ARDS had a histological pattern of diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T‐cell infiltration. In addition, alveolar capillary microthrombi, secondary to endothelial injury, in patients who died of COVID‐19 may be an important cause of refractory hypoxia in ARDS.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0059"" rid=""all14449-bib-0059"">

What is the mechanism underlying Kawasaki syndrome in the context of COVID‐19? </h4><p class=""p p-first-last"">The mechanisms underlying Kawasaki disease—a generalized vasculitis, in young children, of unknown, potentially postviral etiology—are poorly understood. The rare COVID‐19–associated inflammatory syndrome also features vasculitic changes, affects older children too, and is often only associated with positive SARS‐CoV‐2 serology, but not viral shedding. Its mechanisms need to be elucidated and may include postinfectious, antibody, and immune complex–mediated pathology.

The rare COVID‐19–associated inflammatory syndrome also features vasculitic changes, affects older children too, and is often only associated with positive SARS‐CoV‐2 serology, but not viral shedding. Its mechanisms need to be elucidated and may include postinfectious, antibody, and immune complex–mediated pathology.

Excessive inflammation leads to alveolar damage and increased permeability of endothelial and epithelial cells. This results in protein‐rich fluid accumulation in the interstitium and the air space, which causes impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia. Reactive oxygen species, leukocyte proteases, chemokines, and cytokines also contribute to lung injury.

Corticosteroid treatment is generally not recommended, although widely used in critically ill patients. Convalescent plasma (CP) was administered to a small number of patients and was associated with virus clearance and clinical improvement (Table <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid="""" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/table/all14449-tbl-0002/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-tbl-0002"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-tbl-0002"" target=""table""><span>2</span></a>). Low tidal mechanical ventilation, positive end‐expiratory pressure, prone positioning ventilation, and fluid management guidelines were associated with improved outcomes. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could be used according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the EOLIA trial.

</a> experts in the field have developed practical recommendations for optimizing allergic patients’ care while ensuring the safety of all healthcare professionals (Figure <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_all14449-fig-0003"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/figure/all14449-fig-0003/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-fig-0003"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-fig-0003"" target=""figure""><span>3</span></a>). General guidance from national health authorities should be strictly followed (ie, World Health Organization, WHO; European Centre for Disease Prevention).

</a> experts in the field have developed practical recommendations for optimizing allergic patients’ care while ensuring the safety of all healthcare professionals (Figure <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_all14449-fig-0003"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/figure/all14449-fig-0003/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-fig-0003"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-fig-0003"" target=""figure""><span>3</span></a>). General guidance from national health authorities should be strictly followed (ie, World Health Organization, WHO; European Centre for Disease Prevention). In‐person consultations should be minimized to the lowest necessary level and triaged by telemedicine whenever possible (Figure <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_all14449-fig-0004"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/figure/all14449-fig-0004/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-fig-0004"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-fig-0004"" target=""figure""><span>4</span></a>).<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0124"" rid=""all14449-bib-0124"">

</a> Special attention should be paid to data protection in adherence to national data security and protection laws. Nondelayable diagnostic and therapeutic measures should strictly follow reasonable preventive measures. Several specific considerations regarding diagnostic and therapeutic measures are important in different allergic diseases (Figure <a class=""fig-table-link figpopup"" co-legend-rid=""lgnd_all14449-fig-0005"" href=""/pmc/articles/PMC7323196/figure/all14449-fig-0005/"" rid-figpopup=""all14449-fig-0005"" rid-ob=""ob-all14449-fig-0005"" target=""figure""><span>5</span></a>). Moreover, sociopsychological aspects play a fundamental role in the care of allergic patients during the current pandemic and should be especially recognized and followed. Stress caused by isolation and stigmatization due to allergic symptoms may amplify the development of allergic symptoms.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0125"" rid=""all14449-bib-0125"">

Before clinical examination, it is recommended to question all patients about contact with confirmed COVID‐19 patients, fever, respiratory symptoms, and recent sudden loss of smell and/or taste. During nasal endoscopy, distance between the endoscopist and patient can be maximized by using a tower with a camera, screen, and light source, rather than using an eyepiece. Also, manipulations should be limited if possible (ie, nasal inspection vs debridement with suction and/or forceps).

Are common antihypertensive drugs useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID‐19?</h3><p class=""p p-first-last"">Common antihypertensive drugs inhibit ACE, but not ACE2. Importantly, ACE2 opposes ACE actions and lowers blood pressure by converting angiotensin‐II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into its metabolites—angiotensin (1‐7) (vasodilators).<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0216"" rid=""all14449-bib-0216"">

</a> Other common related antihypertensive drugs are angiotensin‐2 receptors blockers, which block AT‐1, a receptor for angiotensin‐II, through which it exerts its vasoconstrictor effect. However, AT‐1 is not known to be used by SARS‐CoV‐2 to infect cells. It was shown in animal models that ACE inhibitors might increase ACE2 expression, thus increasing susceptibility to infection.

However, AT‐1 is not known to be used by SARS‐CoV‐2 to infect cells. It was shown in animal models that ACE inhibitors might increase ACE2 expression, thus increasing susceptibility to infection.

</a> Avoidance of high virus loads, acquired through aerosol and droplet transmission, is paramount to prevent severe outcomes. Consequently, social distancing, masks, and hand sanitation are undoubtedly effective because they prevent the droplet and surface contact–associated initial high virus load and the increased risk of severe disease.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0276"" rid=""all14449-bib-0276"">

What is the evidence supporting social distancing and face mask to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection?</h3><p class=""p p-first-last"">A systematic review and meta‐analysis has found that transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 (OR 0.18) and protection was increased as distance was lengthened. In addition, face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (OR 0.15), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar. Eye protection also was associated with less infection (OR 0.22).<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0279"" rid=""all14449-bib-0279"">
<sup>279</sup>
</a> Therefore, the COVID‐19 pandemic can be controlled if social distancing is combined with widespread testing, case isolation, vigorous contact tracing, and personal protection. Indeed, severe and critical illness among Chinese healthcare workers before January 10 was 45%, a time when personal protection equipment and infectious control measures were likely not implemented. After February 1, when personal protection measures were in place, the percentage of severe and critically ill Chinese healthcare workers dropped to 8.7%.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0280"" rid=""all14449-bib-0280"">

What is the relative risk to contract SARS‐CoV‐2 infection through surfaces?</h3><p class=""p p-first-last"">SARS‐CoV‐2 remained viable in aerosols for 3 hours with a ~10‐fold reduction in infectious titer.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0281"" rid=""all14449-bib-0281"">
<sup>281</sup>
</a> SARS‐CoV‐2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard; viable virus was detected up to 3 days after application to plastic and 2 days to stainless steel, on each surface, the virus titer was reduced nearly ~100‐fold.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0281"" rid=""all14449-bib-0281"">

</a> Importantly, sunlight exposure inactivated 98% of infectious SARS‐CoV‐2 every 6.8 minutes in simulated saliva and every 14.3 minutes in culture media.

Do some COVID‐19 patients act as “superspreaders”?</h3><p class=""p p-first-last"">The individual variation in the transmission of an infection is described by a factor called “dispersion factor or <em>k</em>.” The lower the “<em>k”</em> value, the more transmission comes from a small proportion of individuals acting like superspreaders. Superspreading clusters have been observed in past coronavirus outbreaks (SARS/MERS), where a small number of infected individuals were responsible for a large proportion of secondary transmissions, with an estimated “<em>k”</em> of about 0.16 for SARS and 0.25 for MERS.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0285"" rid=""all14449-bib-0285"">

</a> It is unclear whether superspreading clusters have contributed to the COVID‐19 outbreak. A simulation of early outbreak trajectories estimated that “<em>k</em>” for COVID‐19 is higher than for SARS and MERS.<a class=""bibr popnode"" href=""#all14449-bib-0285"" rid=""all14449-bib-0285"">
<sup>285</sup>
