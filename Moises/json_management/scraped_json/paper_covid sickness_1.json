Here, we highlight recent studies on COVID\u201019, from the clinical and immunological characteristics to the protective and risk factors for severity and mortality of COVID\u201019. The efficacy of the COVID\u201019 vaccines and potential allergic reactions after administration are also discussed. The occurrence of new variants of concerns such as Omicron BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 and the global administration of COVID\u201019 vaccines have changed the clinical scenario of COVID\u201019. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS\u2010C) may cause severe and heterogeneous disease but with a lower mortality rate. Perturbations in immunity of T cells, B cells, and mast cells, as well as autoantibodies and metabolic reprogramming may contribute to the long\u2010term symptoms of COVID\u201019. There is conflicting evidence about whether atopic diseases, such as allergic asthma and rhinitis, are associated with a lower susceptibility and better outcomes of COVID\u201019. At the beginning of pandemic, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) developed guidelines that provided timely information for the management of allergic diseases and preventive measures to reduce transmission in the allergic clinics. The global distribution of COVID\u201019 vaccines and emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) variants with reduced pathogenic potential dramatically decreased the morbidity, severity, and mortality of COVID\u201019. Nevertheless, breakthrough infection remains a challenge for disease control. Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to COVID\u201019 vaccines are low compared to other vaccines, and these were addressed in EAACI statements that provided indications for the management of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis to COVID\u201019 vaccines. We have gained a depth knowledge and experience in the over 2 years since the start of the pandemic, and yet a full eradication of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is not on the horizon. Novel strategies are warranted to prevent severe disease in high\u2010risk groups, the development of MIS\u2010C and long COVID\u201019.Keywords: allergy, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2, COVID\u201019, immunity, vaccine1. INTRODUCTIONThe COVID\u201019 pandemic, caused by infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, has led to alarming numbers of infections and deaths worldwide since it was first reported in December 2019. 1 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the beta\u2010coronavirus genus and is closely related to SARS\u2010CoV. 2 , 3 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds to angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike protein to enter cells. 3 , 4 The host serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the spike protein and thus enable cellular membrane fusion. 5 , 6 The host protease furin cleaves the full\u2010length spike precursor to S1 and S2 peptides. 7 S1 directly binds to neuropilin\u20101 on the cell surface and may facilitate cell invasion and infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 7 , 8 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas other host molecules that may be involved in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 invasion such as CD147, cyclophilins, CD26, and related molecules are expressed in both epithelium and immune cells. 9 The global administration of COVID\u201019 vaccines has dramatically decreased the infection rate, severity, and mortality of this disease. 10 , 11 However, new SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants of concern (VOC) have emerged that will dampen the protective immunity induced by natural infection and current vaccines and lead to breakthrough infection. 12 , 13 In this review, we highlight recent studies on the clinical and immunological characteristics of COVID\u201019 in the context of allergy and asthma. The impact of asthma on the susceptibility and severity of COVID\u201019 is not fully understood and it is discussed here in further detail. Moreover, recent studies on the immune responses and protective effects of COVID\u201019 vaccines are summarized. The possible culprit components of the vaccines that can induce an allergic reaction are elaborated, along with appropriate vaccination measures for reducing the risk of anaphylaxis.2. CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID\u2010192.1. Clinical characteristics of COVID\u201019The clinical scenarios of COVID\u201019 are diverse and range from asymptomatic to critical illness and even fatal outcomes. 6 The symptoms of COVID\u201019 include dry cough, fatigue, fever, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, and respiratory failure. 1 Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions have been also identified as distinct symptoms of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, especially in the western countries. 14 Thus, the respiratory symptoms of COVID\u201019 may be confused with those of allergic rhinitis (AR) and the common cold. 15 Skin manifestations of COVID\u201019 include vesicular, urticarial, and maculopapular eruptions and livedo, necrosis, and other vasculitis forms 16 and are more common among European and North Americans than among Asians. 17 The heterogeneity of COVID\u201019 warrants the elucidation of the phenotypes and endotypes of COVID\u201019 that will benefit from precision medicine. 18 , 19 In addition, persistent symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, body aches, and loss of smell may persist for months following acute infection and are referred as post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 syndrome or long\u2010COVID. 20 , 21 After a 1\u2010year follow\u2010up, most COVID\u201019\u2010recovered patients regain their physical and functional status, although it remains lower than individuals without infection. 22 Children younger than 15 years of age appear to be susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, although most of them are asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms. 23 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS\u2010C) has been described in COVID\u201019 patients with an overall 2% mortality. 24 MIS\u2010C predominantly affects children between 6 and 12 years. Most MIS\u2010C children were critically ill, mostly from shock and/or left ventricular dysfunction, with less severe or no respiratory involvement. 25 Regarding the treatment of MIS\u2010C, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus glucocorticoids were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular dysfunctions but not the recovery from disease when compared to IVIG treatment alone. 26 , 27 2.2. Laboratory findings of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infectionThe nucleic acid amplification test using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) is now widely used for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Modifications on RT\u2010qPCR such as sample pooling test and using probes against replication intermediates and new variants, and novel methods such as next\u2010generation sequencing, microfluidic assays, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2010associated\u2013based diagnostic testing have been adopted to enhance the diagnostic efficacy and sensitivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 28 IgG antibody assay against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1 domain was developed as an alternative diagnostic test, albeit with varying accuracies depending on the assay used. 29 Overall, antibody tests for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have high specificity but relatively lower sensitivity, which varied with different immunoassays and epitopes. 30 Antigen testing is inexpensive, can provide results in a few minutes, and be performed at home. Population\u2010wide antigen testing was demonstrated to reduce the transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 31 Asymptomatic SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is associated with a longer duration of viral shedding and needs to be promptly detected to stop viral transmission. 32 , 33 The concentrations of neutrophil extracellular traps increase in the plasma, trachea aspirate, and lung autopsies and contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID\u201019. 34 , 35 Thus, blood neutrophil extracellular traps can be a potential biomarker for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. In addition, asymptomatic patients have lower levels of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 specific IgG antibodies, which decay during the early convalescent phase. 32 Laboratory changes during COVID\u201019 have been reviewed and are summarized in our previous studies. 36 , 37 White blood cells, lymphopenia, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, high\u2010sensitivity C\u2010reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)\u20106, IL\u20101\u03b2, Krebs von den Lungen\u20106, and ferritin were identified as potential biomarkers for monitoring the progression and predicting the outcomes of COVID\u201019. 37 , 38 Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches have been developed to help select the most useful laboratory sets of laboratory findings to diagnose COVID\u201019 more efficiently. 39 One ML model was constructed based on laboratory parameters and chest CT scan to differentiate between COVID\u201019 and other viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and other pneumonia. 39 , 40 Another study trained several ML models using data on reported comorbidities, medications, symptoms, and laboratory parameters on hospital admission and over the disease course to rapidly identify SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive patients, high\u2010risk patients, and recognize longitudinal warning signs of a possible fatal outcome. 40 ML models, and likely together with artificial intelligence, may be helpful in the construction of decision tree of COVID\u201019 in the future.3. RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR SUSCEPTIBILITY, SEVERITY, AND MORTALITY OF COVID\u2010193.1. Protective factorsHealth systems resilience is critical for the control of the COVID\u201019 pandemic. 41 A healthy diet has been identified as a protective factor against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 36 Both the incidence rate and mortality of COVID\u201019 were lower in Bacillus Calmette\u2010Guerin (BCG)\u2010vaccinated countries than in those without vaccination program. 42 , 43 Moreover, BCG vaccination during early childhood seems to selectively protect against infection in the elderly. 44 BCG was suggested to enhance innate immune responses, leading to \u201ctrained immunity\u201d and confer protection against viral infections. 45 Similarly, recent administration of the mumps\u2010measles\u2010rubella vaccine was observed to be associated with a reduction in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in males 46 and severity of COVID\u201019, 47 although the real correlation between this vaccine and COVID\u201019 is still unclear. 48 Lower levels of nasal ACE2 49 and airway cathepsin L/CTSL1, 50 a protease that cleaves and primes the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, may contribute to the mild disease of COVID\u201019 in children. Atopy and type 2 inflammation have been shown to be associated with a decreased expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells and thus lower susceptibility to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 51 Mechanistically, the type 2 cytokine IL\u201013 reduced ACE2 expression, 51 intracellular viral load, and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission, while increasing the cilial keratan sulfate coating in airway epithelial cells, suggesting a role of IL\u201013 in attenuating viral shedding and thus reducing the entry, replication, and spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 52 IL\u201013 in combination with mucus was shown to reduce SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA by 90%\u201397% after inoculation of this virus in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. 53 Another recent study in preprint also demonstrated that IL\u201013 decreased the expression of long ACE2 mRNA and reduced glycosylation of full\u2010length ACE2 protein, leading to reduction in the apical expression of ACE2 on the ciliated airway epithelial cells. 54 These data indicate that the inflammatory milieu may be an important factor affecting the expression of ACE2 and other SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010relevant receptors, and thus affect the susceptibility and infection. Genetic variation of allergic disease was associated with a lower risk of COVID\u201019. 55 Most studies suggested that AR and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are not associated with a higher risk of susceptibility and severity of COVID\u201019, 36 , 56 , 57 although reduced ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from patients with concomitant AR and allergic asthma. 51 The expression of ACE2 in nasal polyp tissues of patients with CRS was lower than that of healthy controls. 58 The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the olfactory mucosa was also lower patients of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) compared to healthy controls, and the protein expression of ACE2 was negatively correlated with eosinophils numbers in olfactory mucosa. 59 Moreover, the expression of ACE2 was upregulated by interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3 and downregulated by type 2 cytokines in nasal epithelial cells. 51 , 60 , 61 On the other hand, another study showed that early Th2 inflammation and attenuated IFN\u2010\u03b3 production in the nose may indicate worse clinical outcomes. 62 Moreover, elevated IL\u201013 was associated with severe COVID\u201019, and this effect may be due to IL\u201013\u2010induced hyaluronan deposition in the lung. Treatment with dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL\u20104 and IL\u201013, was associated with less severe COVID\u201019, while IL\u201013 neutralization reduced hyaluronan deposition and disease severity and death in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013infected mice. 63 Based on the results of this study, a pilot phase IIA clinical trial observing the safety and efficacy of dupilumab on forty moderate or severe COVID\u201019 patients found that dupilumab did not increase the ventilator\u2010free survival at day 28, but it did reduce the mortality at day 60 when compared to placebo. 64 All these data suggest a complex association among type 2 inflammation, ACE2 expression, IL\u201013, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and COVID\u201019 outcomes.The corticosteroid dexamethasone can increase ventilator\u2010free days 65 and reduce the death rate 66 in severe and critically ill COVID\u201019 patients. Mechanistically, dexamethasone treatment was shown to restrain neutrophil pathogenicity by reducing IFNactive\u2010neutrophils and expanding immunosuppressive immature neutrophils. 67 Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduced the level of ACE2 in induced sputum 68 from asthma patients and in bronchial epithelia from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. 69 Clinical studies reported that inhaled budesonide in COVID\u201019 patients reduced time to recovery and resulted in less severe outcome. 70 , 71 Thus, proper systemic and ICS treatment may benefit to COVID\u201019 patients. Inhalable SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010specific siRNA and human ACE2\u2010containing nanocatchers were shown to reduce SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection 72 , 73 and lung inflammation, 72 as shown in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected mice.3.2. Risk factorsThe emergence of new variants of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, such as Omicron and its subvariants, present a challenge for the eradication of COVID\u201019 as they have evolved immune escape from the neutralizing antibodies developed in previous infections and vaccinations. 74 , 75 COVID\u201019 breakthrough infection associated with the new variants has become a major concern. 76 Whole genome sequencing revealed two distinct mechanisms that can predispose an individual to life\u2010threatening COVID\u201019, namely failure to control viral replication or an enhanced tendency toward pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. 77 Older age, male sex, cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, racial/ethnic disparities, chronic kidney diseases, and cancer have been identified as risk factors for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and worse outcomes of COVID\u201019. 36 , 37 A recent meta\u2010analysis identified that obesity was associated with an increased risk of COVID\u201019\u2010related hospitalization and death, especially for those with extreme obesity. 78 Healthcare workers are at higher risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection compared to non\u2010healthcare workers. 37 , 79 Blood levels of neutrophil elastase 80 and histone\u2010DNA 81 were associated with severe, systemic, and multi\u2010organ manifestations of COVID\u201019. Higher levels of bacterial DNA in the system circulation were associated with severe and fatal COVID\u201019. 82 COVID\u201019 patients with inborn errors of immunity, except type I IFN immunity errors, exhibit an almost similar natural COVID\u201019 course compared to the general population. 83 Interestingly, individuals with blood group A are at higher risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and severe disease, whereas blood group O may be protective against COVID\u201019. 84 The higher expression of entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 increase the susceptibility to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 36 Smoking was associated with higher expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN, and BSG in bronchial brushes 9 and represents a risk factor for COVID\u201019 mortality when not adjusted for chronic respiratory diseases. 85 Air pollution has been shown to be associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and COVID\u201019 mortality. 86 Mechanistically, air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matters (PM) may disrupt the airway epithelial barrier and impair the defense against respiratory viruses. 86 , 87 The airway epithelial barrier interacts with the respiratory microbiome to shape the immune response in the lungs. 88 In addition, air pollution may contribute to chronic systemic inflammation and a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, which have been demonstrated to be risk factors for severe COVID\u201019. 87 , 89 , 90 Air pollution is also correlated with a higher expression of ACE2 receptor in the lung. 91 Furthermore, fine PMs such as PM2.5 and PM10 may act as carriers of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and promote the transmission of this virus. 89 Lockdown during COVID\u201019 was associated with a reduction in PM2.5 concentrations due to reduced traffic emission. 92 Interestingly, the concentrations of airborne pollen correlated with the infection rates of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in thirty\u2010one countries across both hemispheres. 93 This may be attributed to the impairment of innate antiviral immunity of airway epithelia upon pollen exposure. 93 The severity and excess death rate of COVID\u201019 in northern Italy were suggested to have a link with the increased air pollution, 87 in accordance with several other studies. 94 , 95 , 96 3.3. New variants of concernsNew variants of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 emerged sequentially, becoming the predominant strains during the pandemic. These variants have distinct ACE2 binding affinity, virulence, transmissibility, and host immune responses 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 , 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 , 108 , 109 (Figure 1). Currently, the most pronounced risk factor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is the emergence of new variants or subvariants that are resistant to neutralizing antibodies and with higher transmissibility. 110 The subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, most likely stem from Omicron lineage BA.2, 110 were first spotted in South Africa 108 , 110 and are now spreading to Europe, the United States, 111 and other regions worldwide. 112 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 belong to the single\u2010strand RNA (ssRNA) virus, like rhinovirus (RV) and influenza virus. However, variants Delta and Omicron are distinct from RV and influenza in many aspects including classification, virion size, receptors, risk groups, and incubation period and mortality after infection. The biological and clinical characteristics of RV, influenza A, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 are compared in Table 1.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Daily new cases and deaths, and the characteristics of different mutations in the COVID\u201019 coronavirus pandemic.

However, in Portugal, the hospitalization and mortality caused by BA.4/5 were similar to that in the first wave of Omicron infection, which may be due to the higher proportion of elderly individuals in this country. 110 BA.4 and BA.5 carry additional mutations in the spike proteins assisting the immune escape from protection induced by 3\u2010dose vaccinations and by post\u2010vaccination infection of BA.1. 113 , 114 The Omicron variant is continuously evolving to escape antibody neutralization resulting in breakthrough infection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in both vaccinated and in previously infected individuals. 115 4. COVID\u201019 AND ASTHMAObservational studies indicate a potential protective factor of asthma for the morbidity and mortality of COVID\u201019, 1 , 56 although conflicting data from the United States and United Kingdom (UK) suggested a higher prevalence of asthma in COVID\u201019 patients. 131 A UK study found that asthmatic patients were associated with a higher risk of COVID\u201019. 132 For allergic asthma, the protective effects have been partly attributed to the antiviral effect of eosinophils, 36 whose beneficial effects on COVID\u201019 outcomes depend on ICS. 133 However, whether COVID\u201019 patients with asthma are at higher risk of long\u2010COVID symptoms is still unclear as there are contradictory research studies. 134 , 135 It remains unclear whether asthma is a risk factor for the severe and worse outcome of COVID\u201019. However, it appears to be related to the asthma phenotypes, treatments, and severity. 136 , 137 Studies demonstrated that Th2\u2010high inflammation may be associated with reduced, while Th2\u2010low inflammation may be associated with increased risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and severity of COVID\u201019. 138 Asthma was shown to be associated with an increased hospitalization risk of COVID\u201019 both in adults 56 and in children. 139 Another study observed an increased hospitalization rate only in asthmatic patients needing regular ICS or regular/intermittent ICS with add\u2010on therapy. 132 The hospitalization rate of allergic asthmatics was 50% lower compared to non\u2010allergic asthmatics. 135 A recent meta\u2010analysis identified preexisting asthma as a risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU) admission among COVID\u201019 patients. 140 The heterogeneity of asthma endotypes (allergic vs. non\u2010allergic asthma) may underly the different disease course in these studies. 36 , 135 Eosinopenia was associated with worse outcomes of COVID\u201019, including longer duration of hospitalization, higher severity, and mortality. 1 , 37 , 135 Dynamic monitoring of eosinophils counts in addition to other laboratory indices, such as neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocytes ratio lymphocytopenia and D\u2010dimer, may be used as predictive biomarkers of the outcomes of COVID\u201019. 36 , 37 Biologicals were associated with lower susceptibility in asthmatic patients. 141 Omalizumab\u2010augmented IFN\u2010\u03b1 production from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, 142 which may also contribute to the protecting effects of asthma against COVID\u201019.A lower expression of ACE2 in bronchial epithelial or lung tissue was observed in allergic asthmatic patients. 131 , 143 , 144 In addition, ICS may decrease the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in bronchial epithelia of asthmatic patients 68 and thus contribute to lower susceptibility to infection. A recent study in preprint showed that prior infection with rhinovirus restricted SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 replication, but co\u2010infection augmented retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene 1 (RIG\u20101) inflammasome activation and epithelial inflammation in patients with asthma, especially in the presence of house dust mites. 145 In a summary, the relationship between asthma, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and COVID\u201019 is complex and may be associated with the inflammatory phenotypes, treatments, and comorbidities. 146 5. LONG COVID\u201019A large number of patients recovering from COVID\u201019 may suffer from long\u2010term complications of COVID\u201019 including a large variety of symptoms, defined as \u201cpost\u2010acute COVID\u201019 syndrome\u201d or \u201clong COVID\u201019\u201d. 147 The symptoms of long COVID\u201019 are summarized in Table 2. The current evidence does not indicate an increased risk of long COVID\u201019 in asthmatic patients, although studies with more patients are warranted. 144 Mechanistically, long COVID\u201019 patients were characterized with over\u2010activated innate immune cells, lacked naive T and B cells, and showed persistent elevated expression of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03bb1 at 8 months after infection. 148 Mast cell activation may also contribute to long\u2010term COVID\u201019 as evidenced by persistent mediators release. 149 Activated inflammatory caspases can induce pyroptosis, which may partly contribute to lymphopenia in COVID\u201019, and the caspases inhibitors have been suggested to be potential therapeutics for severe and long COVID\u201019. 150 Preexisting and de novo autoantibodies were more frequently detected in hospitalized or severe COVID\u201019 patients and may play a role in post\u2010acute sequelae of COVID\u201019. 151 Dysregulated respiratory CD8+ T cell responses were associated with impaired lung function after acute COVID\u201019. 152 The mechanisms underlying COVID\u201019 are still not fully understood. Currently, it was suggested that poor viral clearance, persistent inflammation, and autoimmunity were proposed as the major mechanisms contributing to long COVID\u201019. 153 , 154 , 155 , 156 Elderly or female COVID\u201019 patients, or those previously with a severe COVID\u201019 disease are prone to have long COVID\u201019, which may be associated with persistent dendritic cell deficiency, lymphopenia, and dysbiosis (Figure 2).TABLE 2Reported symptoms of post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 syndrome or long COVID\u201019Organs and systemsSymptomsGeneral statusFatigue, general asthenia, low fever, dizziness, sweating 147 , 157 Neuro\u2010psychiatric systemHeadache, insomnia, depression, distress, anxiety, dysphoria, post\u2010traumatic stress disorder, memory loss, loss of attention, anorexia, other mental health conditions 147 , 158 , 159 Cardiovascular systemsChest pain, palpitation, elevated heart rate, diastolic dysfunction, stress cardiomyopathy, changes in cardiac MRI, ongoing elevation in high\u2010sensitivity troponin T 20 , 147 , 158 , 159 , 160 Upper respiratory tractRunny nose, anosmia, sore throat, blocked nose 147 , 158 Pulmonary systemCough, phlegm, hemoptysis, chest tightness, chest pain, shortness of breath, ventilator and oxygen dependence, chest imaging abnormality, fibrotic lung disease, impaired pulmonary function 147 , 158 , 159 Gastrointestinal systemAbdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, loss of appetite 158 Hepato\u2010biliary systemNausea, jaundice, transaminase increase 158 Endocrine and metabolic systemNew\u2010onset hyperglycemia and diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, subacute thyroiditis 147 , 159 Genito\u2010urinary systemProteinuria, hematuria, development of kidney injury, uncontrolled bladder, pollakiuria 20 , 158 , 161 Vascular complicationsThromboembolism, bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation 20 , 153 ReproductionMale infertility 159 Musculoskeletal systemArthralgia, myalgia, muscle weakness 158 , 159 Dermatological complicationsMaculopapular exanthem, papulovesicular rash, urticaria, painful red acral purple papules, hair loss 158 , 159 OthersConjunctivitis, neck pain 153 Open in a separate windowOpen in a separate windowFIGURE 2Proposed mechanisms of long COVID\u201019. This schematic diagram shows the possible relevant factors contributing to long COVID\u201019. Persistent tissue damage and inflammation might be the major mechanisms of persistent symptoms of COVID\u201019. In addition, persistent dendritic cell deficiency, autoimmunity, and dysbiosis may also contribute to the long\u2010term symptoms. Severe disease, aging, and female are suggested as risk factors for the development of long COVID\u201019.6. IMMUNE RESPONSES AND PATHOGENESIS OF COVID\u201019The immunological pathogenicity of COVID\u201019 is complex and may be associated with the virulence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the lack of the temporal coordination between innate and adaptive immune responsces. 162 , 163 , 164 Other mechanisms such as pre\u2010existing immunity to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, superantigens, and autoimmunity have been also suggested to participate in the immune responses to this virus. 165 Adaptive responses to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 develop mainly to the spike protein. It is postulated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA is sensed by toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u20103/7/8 and activates innate immune pathways. 154 , 166 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can also be recognized by RIG\u2010I, the cytoplasmic sensor of RNA. 167 , 168 The interaction of RIG\u20101 with viral genome directly abrogates viral replication in lung cells 167 ; on the contrary, the activation of RIG\u20101 by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 triggers the epithelial cells to release inflammatory mediators, which then stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation, especially in the presence of exogenous inflammatory stimuli. 168 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 replication induced a delayed type I IFN response in lung epithelial cells, which is regulated by melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA5). 169 Activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes participates in the pathophysiology of COVID\u201019 and is associated with the severity of the disease. 170 Type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral responses and activation of both CD4+Th1 and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes result in viral clearance in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected subjects with mild symptoms. 171 Impairment in the number and function of dendritic cells may also lead to dysregulation in innate and adaptive immunity including antiviral response. 165 , 172 The insufficient antiviral response, 173 or autoantibodies against type I IFNs, 174 , 175 combined with the system inflammation induced by a large number of immune cells and resident tissue cells, may contribute to the cytokine storm in severe disease. 154 Virus\u2010specific IgM and IgA can be detected in the acute phase followed by an increase in virus\u2010specific IgG at a later stage of COVID\u201019. 165 More severe COVID\u201019 patients were associated with higher anti\u2010RBD IgA and IgG antibody responses when compared to those not hospitalized or asymptomatic. No deaths were reported in patients with higher an IgG antibody index (NT50/IgG >100). 176 Dupilumab (anti\u2010IL\u20104/13 R\u03b1) used in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients with COVID\u201019 was associated with a lower IgG antibodies response. 177 Poor and delayed anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM and IgG antibodies responses correlated with poor outcomes of COVID\u201019 in children. 178 A visible antibody cross\u2010reactivity was reported in infectious bronchitis virus, a non\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and chicken aerosol vaccines particularly in highly exposed veterinarians who administered the vaccines. However, this immune cross\u2010reactivity did not show a viral neutralizing activity and focused on non\u2010RBD antibodies, which substantially differ between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and non\u2010SARS\u2010CoVs. 179 Mild COVID\u201019 patients exhibited SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010specific memory B and T cells responses that display hallmarks of antiviral immunity. 180 The antigen\u2010driven activation of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 memory B cells persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and may provide long\u2010term protection 181 Diverse autoantibody responses were identified in COVID\u201019 patients and were correlated with disease severity and duration of hospitalization. 175 7. MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC DISEASES DURING THE COVID\u201019 PANDEMICThe COVID\u201019 pandemic has shaped the ways medical services are conducted in order to accommodate for the imposed lockdown and social distancing measures. Accordingly, telemedicine was adopted by many physicians to guide the treatment and follow\u2010up of allergic patients. 182 Continuation of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) was suggested for AR patients with COVID\u201019 at the recommended doses. 183 Treatment with INCS before SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was associated with a lower risk of COVID\u201019\u2010related hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. 184 A systematic review assessed the use of INCS on the olfactory dysfunction of COVID\u201019 patients, but only identified a single study to include in the review. 185 The impact of INCS on the susceptibility and outcomes of COVID\u201019 is still inconclusive. 57 Oral corticosteroids, biologicals, and surgical treatment should be avoided or suspended in CRS patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 57 Telemedicine was advocated to replace in\u2010person visits for the care of CRS patients during the COVID\u201019 pandemic with high patient satisfaction. 186 Inhaled or oral corticosteroids should be continued to for asthmatic patients without SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection to maintain asthma control, and oral corticosteroids and biologicals should be continued to treat severe asthma exacerbations. 187 In the case of asthmatic patients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, the use of inhalers should be indicated over nebulizers for the delivery of aerosolized medications to avoid viral transmission via aerosol. 188 Current evidence suggests that treatment with biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation does not increase the risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and COVID\u201019 severity 138 and may have beneficial effects. 141 Therefore, biologicals may be continued during COVID\u201019 for asthmatic patients without SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) should be temporarily discontinued until recovery for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive asthmatic patients or in contact with confirmed cases of COVID\u201019. 189 AIT can be continued in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 negative confirmed patients but with a prolonged injection interval. 189 Switching from subcutaneous to sublingual immunotherapy may be considered for AIT during COVID\u201019. 190 Skin manifestations of COVID\u201019 may be similar to other viral infections and drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs). 191 , 192 The diagnosis and management of DHRs induced by medications repurposed and off\u2010label for the treatment of COVID\u201019 have been discussed in a few review papers. 191 , 192 , 193 Pulmonary function tests such as spirometry should be restricted to those patients with high clinical priority and using a high\u2010efficiency inline filter. The patients should be encouraged to perform peak expiratory flow measurement at home to reduce the possible transmission via small droplets and aerosol generated during the pulmonary function test. 194 , 195 Many studies have focused on the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on the status and control of allergic diseases. In asthmatic children, environmental changes, altered medical practice, and medication use, changes in transportation and travel patterns, school attendance, and physical activity impacted asthma control during the pandemic. 196 A survey revealed that the majority of the AD patients experienced AD flares with mild worsening of the disease during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. 197 Dupilumab seems to be safe and crucial for a better outcome of COVID\u201019 and should be continued in AD patients during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. 198 During COVID\u201019, AIT was initiated and continued by most physicians in patients without indications of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 199 In contrast, lockdown during COVID\u201019 resulted in decreased numbers of patients initiating AIT but without significant impact on sublingual immunotherapy. 200 COVID\u201019 was reported to increase the incidence of acute urticaria 201 and disease activity of chronic urticaria in males but not females, which may be associated with loss of omalizumab efficacy. 202 Single\u2010cell sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed that the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID\u201019 may promote the activation of monocytes/macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which may be involved in the development of maculopapular drug rash associated with COVID\u201019. 203 8. COVID\u201019 VACCINESNatural SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection does not establish a strong antibody response that can prevent reinfection. 204 COVID\u201019 vaccines offer promising protective immunity against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Two groups of vaccines are available for the global vaccination strategy for COVID\u201019. The classic group includes subunit, inactivated, live\u2010attenuated, and virus\u2010like particle vaccines; novel approaches include RNA\u2010based vaccines, which deliver RNA coding target viral proteins into human cells. 205 Two mRNA\u2010based vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer\u2010BioNTech) and Moderna mRNA vaccines were approved with emergency use or conditioned marked authorization by the USA, European Union, and other countries\u2019 governmental agencies. Phase III clinical trials and real\u2010world data suggested that COVID\u201019 vaccines have dramatically reduced severe COVID\u201019 cases 206 and excess mortality due to COVID\u201019 (Figure 3), although breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated individuals is not uncommon. 207 Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Time\u2010series visualization of global daily reported COVID\u201019 deaths, excess mortality estimates, and vaccinations. Source data were downloaded from Our World in Data on August 19, 2022. Excess mortality estimates and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were modeled by the Economist. The lines indicate 7\u2010day rolling averages of daily reported deaths and excess mortality estimates per million people as well as all daily vaccination doses per billion people, including boosters that are counted individually.8.1. Efficacy and immune responses of COVID\u201019 vaccinesThe RBD of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies induced by COVID\u201019 vaccines. Specific IgG antibodies against conformational but not sequential RBD epitopes have the potential to block the binding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with ACE2 and confer protective immunity. 208 Mutations in RBD, as identified in several VOC, display increased binding affinity to ACE2 209 and/or reduced neutralization ability of sera from convalescent and BNT162B2 vaccinated individuals. 210 , 211 , 212 , 213 Noticeably, BNT162b2\u2010induced IgG antibodies had higher avidity to mutated RBD than those induced by natural infection. 74 The variant Omicron exhibited approximately fourfold greater immune escape relative to the Beta variant. 212 Prior COVID\u201019 was associated with higher neutralization capacity for the ancestral virus after BNT162b2 vaccination. 212 More importantly, two doses of mRNA COVID\u201019 vaccines provided almost non\u2010existent, whereas a booster dose yielded almost 75% protection against symptomatic infection of Omicron. 213 It is predicted that BNT162b2 boosted, or vaccination (two doses) combined with the previous infection can prevent 73% symptomatic infection by Omicron, which is significantly higher than in individuals with BNT162b2 vaccination only. 212 Other types of vaccines have also been administered around the world. CVnCoV is a vaccine based on unmodified RNA and induced only a 48% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic disease. 214 CV2CoV is the second\u2010generation unmodified mRNA vaccine but with optimized non\u2010coding regions and enhanced antigen expression. Compared to CVnCoV, CV2CoV induced higher titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants, and memory B and T cell responses in non\u2010human primates. 215 The inactivated Sinopharm/BBIBP COVID\u201019 vaccine is widely used in developing countries including China due to its low storage requirements. Seroconversion rates in unexposed individuals after first and second dose reached 40% and 100%, respectively, and younger individuals and women had the highest antibody concentrations. Previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was associated with a strong antibody response after a single dose of the BBIBP vaccine. A sharp increase in antibody concentrations was observed following SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection after the first and second doses. 216 Virus\u2010like particle\u2010based COVID\u201019 vaccines induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and its variants in mice and rhesus macaques. 217 , 218 PreS\u2010RBD vaccine was developed based on a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the human hepatitis B virus\u2010derived PreS antigen and two SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD domains. It induced a robust anti\u2010RBD IgG response in rabbits consisting of an early IgG1 and sustained IgG4, which can be detected in serum and mucosa secretions. Moreover, the vaccine\u2010induced antibodies potently inhibited the interaction of RBD with ACE2 and possessed the neutralizing ability of the omicron VOC. 219 The efficacy and immune responses elicited by different types of COVID\u201019 vaccines are listed in Table 3.TABLE 3Efficacy and immune response of different SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 vaccinesVaccine nameTypes of vaccinesEfficacy and immune responsesBNT162b2mRNA vaccines 95% effective in preventing COVID\u201019Induced IgG antibodies had higher avidity to mutated RBD than those induced by natural infection 74 , 212 , 223 ModernamRNA vaccines 94.1% efficacy at preventing COVID\u201019Preclinical testing in advanced clinical evaluation has shown a Th1\u2010skewed vaccine response and no pathologic lung infiltrates 224 , 225 , 226 AZD1222Viral vector After the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime\u2010boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81.3% at \u226512 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55.1% at <6 weeks)Higher binding and neutralizing antibody titers in sera with a longer prime\u2010boost interval 227 Sputnik VViral vector 91.6% efficacious against COVID\u201019 (from day 21 after the first dose, to the day of receiving the second dose)RBD\u2010specific IgG was detected in 98% of samples, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 8996, and a seroconversion rate of 98.25%Increased SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 neutralizing antibody titersBy day 28 after the first vaccination, all vaccinated participants had significantly higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion upon antigen restimulation compared with the day of administration of the first dose 228 Ad26.COV2.SViral vector The level of protection for the combined endpoints of moderate and severe disease varied: 72% in the United States; 66% in Latin American countries; and 57% in South Africa, 28 days post\u2010vaccination.

Recently, a diversity of animal experiments and clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the immune responses and the safety and efficacy of intranasal administration of COVID\u201019 vaccines, respectively. 220 It is hypothesized that intranasal vaccination may induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses, 221 and thus the local mucosal immunity may prevent the virus infection through the upper respiratory tract and block transmission to other people. 222 In mice, intranasal administration of virus\u2010based vaccine candidates expression SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein elicited robust specific IgG and IgA antibodies and polyfunctional S\u2010specific Th1\u2010skewed CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T\u2010cell immune responses. 221 Four COVID\u201019 mucosal vaccines have been approved as booster for the prevention of COVID\u201019 infection in China, Russia, India and Iran. 222 The exact efficacy of these mucosal vaccines is still unknown since no clinical trial data are released.8.2. Allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccinesLocal and systemic reactions were reported in phase III clinical trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV\u201019 vaccine, which were mostly mild and moderate in intensity. 241 Cutaneous adverse effects of the available COVID\u201019 vaccines include injection site reactions, urticaria, angioedema, exacerbation of atopic eczema, and systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. 242 Anaphylaxis to the BNT162b2 vaccine was reported several days after the initiation of public vaccinations. 243 Overall, the incidence of COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine\u2010associated anaphylaxis is very low, 244 with only was 4.8 per million doses for BNT162b2 and 5.1 per million doses for mRNA\u20101273 according to data from Vaccine Safety Datalink. 245 Moreover, the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a higher rate of systemic events. 223 Nevertheless, the incidence of anaphylaxis\u2010associated with COVID\u201019 vaccines is comparable to that of other vaccines 246 and the benefits may outweigh the potential risks of COVID\u201019 vaccinations. 247 , 248 Unfortunately, the fear of an allergic reaction has caused vaccine hesitancy in the general public, haltering global vaccination efforts. 249 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an additive present in the Pfizer\u2010BioNtech and Moderna mRNA vaccines used to prevent premature degradation of the nanoparticless, 250 and it has been suggested to be the major culprit for anaphylaxis to COVID\u201019 vaccines. 251 PEG and its derivatives are also widely used in household products including toothpaste, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. 252 Many types of vaccines, therapeutic medications, and diagnostic media contain PEG with different molecular weights and their risks of anaphylaxis have been previously reported. 252 , 253 Exposure to products containing PEG via intravenous and intramuscular injection is the major route causing HSR to PEG. There is a study showing that lipid\u2010conjugated PEG or PEGylated liposomes have a stronger immunogenicity than PEG alone and may contribute to the anaphylaxis elicited by COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccines. 254 , 255 Anti\u2010PEG IgE\u2010mediated HSR, complement activation\u2010related pseudoallergy induced by anti\u2010PEG IgM and IgG antibodies and potential interaction of PEG with mast cells and viral RNA have been suggested to underly COVID\u201019 vaccine anaphylaxis. 254 , 256 IgG and IgM antibodies against PEG were found in up to 25% of the population without known prior exposure to PEGylated products and in up to 89% of patients with known prior exposure to PEGylated products. 257 Other excipients than PEG present in authorized COVID\u201019 vaccines might also cause severe allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines and need appropriate allergological assessment. 258 EAACI suggested performing in vivo tests (skin prick test and intradermal test) and in vitro tests (basophil activation test, BAT) on the vaccines or their components in individuals with severe reactions to the first dose of COVID\u201019 vaccines. 259 The positive rate of skin test with PEG or mRNA vaccine in patients with reactions to COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine or with previous PEG or polysorbate allergies was very low. 260 , 261 Thus, the clinical significance of skin testing with mRNA vaccine in those with negative skin testing results with PEG is still unknown. BAT performed in patients with PEG allergy demonstrated that BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines and PEGylated lipids, but not unmodified PEG, can activate mast cells. 255 Thus, positive BAT results in mRNA vaccines may be a potential diagnostic tool for confirming HSR to PEG excipient.Studies have shown that most individuals with allergic reactions to the first dose tolerated well the second dose irrespective of the skin test results. 262 , 263 Thus, the second dose vaccine may be administered after careful evaluation and under careful monitoring in an allergy clinic. An EAACI position paper recommended that allergic patients without prior allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components and patients with mild and moderate allergies should not be excluded from COVID\u201019 vaccinations. 259 On the contrary, it would put population immunity with vaccination at risk due to the high prevalence of allergic diseases. 259 However, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centers were provided in the EAACI statement to minimize the risk of allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. 259 Anaphylaxis induced by COVID\u201019 vaccines is rare but may be more severe in older people due to comorbidities and polypharmacy. 264 Intramuscular injection of adrenaline remains the first\u2010line therapy for anaphylaxis in older people. 264 Modified dosing or alternative vaccines were recommended by EAACI for those with confirmed reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. 259 Herein, we provide a flow chart for the treatment of allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. This flow chart is modified based on EAACI recommendation and other consensus 259 , 265 , 266 (Figure 4).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4Flow chart for the management of individuals with allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. Allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccine can be divided into immediate and late\u2010onset reactions according to the symptom onset time after injection. Premedication such as antihistamines can be used for those with immediate or late onset local reactions before the next dose of vaccine. Those with systemic symptoms are recommended to be assessed with skin test or basophil activation test (BAT) in an allergy clinic and then treated with premedication or alternative vaccines. 259 , 265 , 266 9. PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONSAnthropogenic activities, climate change, and global population movement set a perfect environment for new outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens. Using the knowledge and experience gained from the COVID\u201019 pandemic, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to predict and prevent the emergence and transmission of novel pathogens. 267 Effective surveillance of new SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants and reporting their transmissibility and rate of breakthrough infection is warranted to assist international policymaking. 268 The trajectory of COVID\u201019 needs to be closely monitored to further our understanding of the immunity waning, antigen drifting, and re\u2010entries from zoonotic reservoirs. 269 As we deepen our knowledge of COVID\u201019, vaccination strategies should be updated and revised, such as frequent administration of booster doses. The continuously mutating virus warrants the development of novel vaccines targeting current variant sequences. 270 The impacts of COVID\u201019 on allergen sensitization and the incidence of allergic disease are still unknown and need to be investigated by the society of allergy and clinical immunology.In conclusion, similarly to other respiratory viruses, full eradication of COVID\u201019 is not on the horizon. Novel strategies should be developed for the prevention and management of this disease, particularly for patients at high risk of severe disease and to prevent MIS\u2010C and long COVID. The emergence of new VOC and global vaccinations efforts have substantially changed the clinical and immunological profiles of COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by Scientific Research Initiative Funds of Shanxi Bethune Hosital.CONFLICT OF INTERESTC.

Here, we highlight recent studies on COVID\u201019, from the clinical and immunological characteristics to the protective and risk factors for severity and mortality of COVID\u201019. The efficacy of the COVID\u201019 vaccines and potential allergic reactions after administration are also discussed", ". The occurrence of new variants of concerns such as Omicron BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 and the global administration of COVID\u201019 vaccines have changed the clinical scenario of COVID\u201019. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS\u2010C) may cause severe and heterogeneous disease but with a lower mortality rate. Perturbations in immunity of T cells, B cells, and mast cells, as well as autoantibodies and metabolic reprogramming may contribute to the long\u2010term symptoms of COVID\u201019. There is conflicting evidence about whether atopic diseases, such as allergic asthma and rhinitis, are associated with a lower susceptibility and better outcomes of COVID\u201019. At the beginning of pandemic, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) developed guidelines that provided timely information for the management of allergic diseases and preventive measures to reduce transmission in the allergic clinics", ". The global distribution of COVID\u201019 vaccines and emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) variants with reduced pathogenic potential dramatically decreased the morbidity, severity, and mortality of COVID\u201019. Nevertheless, breakthrough infection remains a challenge for disease control. Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to COVID\u201019 vaccines are low compared to other vaccines, and these were addressed in EAACI statements that provided indications for the management of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis to COVID\u201019 vaccines. We have gained a depth knowledge and experience in the over 2 years since the start of the pandemic, and yet a full eradication of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is not on the horizon. Novel strategies are warranted to prevent severe disease in high\u2010risk groups, the development of MIS\u2010C and long COVID\u201019.Keywords: allergy, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2, COVID\u201019, immunity, vaccine1", ". INTRODUCTIONThe COVID\u201019 pandemic, caused by infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, has led to alarming numbers of infections and deaths worldwide since it was first reported in December 2019. 1 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the beta\u2010coronavirus genus and is closely related to SARS\u2010CoV. 2 , 3 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds to angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike protein to enter cells. 3 , 4 The host serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the spike protein and thus enable cellular membrane fusion. 5 , 6 The host protease furin cleaves the full\u2010length spike precursor to S1 and S2 peptides. 7 S1 directly binds to neuropilin\u20101 on the cell surface and may facilitate cell invasion and infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 7 , 8 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas other host molecules that may be involved in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 invasion such as CD147, cyclophilins, CD26, and related molecules are expressed in both epithelium and immune cells", ". 9 The global administration of COVID\u201019 vaccines has dramatically decreased the infection rate, severity, and mortality of this disease. 10 , 11 However, new SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants of concern (VOC) have emerged that will dampen the protective immunity induced by natural infection and current vaccines and lead to breakthrough infection. 12 , 13 In this review, we highlight recent studies on the clinical and immunological characteristics of COVID\u201019 in the context of allergy and asthma. The impact of asthma on the susceptibility and severity of COVID\u201019 is not fully understood and it is discussed here in further detail. Moreover, recent studies on the immune responses and protective effects of COVID\u201019 vaccines are summarized. The possible culprit components of the vaccines that can induce an allergic reaction are elaborated, along with appropriate vaccination measures for reducing the risk of anaphylaxis.2. CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID\u2010192.1", ". CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID\u2010192.1. Clinical characteristics of COVID\u201019The clinical scenarios of COVID\u201019 are diverse and range from asymptomatic to critical illness and even fatal outcomes. 6 The symptoms of COVID\u201019 include dry cough, fatigue, fever, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, and respiratory failure. 1 Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions have been also identified as distinct symptoms of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, especially in the western countries. 14 Thus, the respiratory symptoms of COVID\u201019 may be confused with those of allergic rhinitis (AR) and the common cold. 15 Skin manifestations of COVID\u201019 include vesicular, urticarial, and maculopapular eruptions and livedo, necrosis, and other vasculitis forms 16 and are more common among European and North Americans than among Asians. 17 The heterogeneity of COVID\u201019 warrants the elucidation of the phenotypes and endotypes of COVID\u201019 that will benefit from precision medicine", ". 18 , 19 In addition, persistent symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, body aches, and loss of smell may persist for months following acute infection and are referred as post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 syndrome or long\u2010COVID. 20 , 21 After a 1\u2010year follow\u2010up, most COVID\u201019\u2010recovered patients regain their physical and functional status, although it remains lower than individuals without infection. 22 Children younger than 15 years of age appear to be susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, although most of them are asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms. 23 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS\u2010C) has been described in COVID\u201019 patients with an overall 2% mortality. 24 MIS\u2010C predominantly affects children between 6 and 12 years. Most MIS\u2010C children were critically ill, mostly from shock and/or left ventricular dysfunction, with less severe or no respiratory involvement", ". 25 Regarding the treatment of MIS\u2010C, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus glucocorticoids were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular dysfunctions but not the recovery from disease when compared to IVIG treatment alone. 26 , 27 2.2. Laboratory findings of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infectionThe nucleic acid amplification test using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) is now widely used for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Modifications on RT\u2010qPCR such as sample pooling test and using probes against replication intermediates and new variants, and novel methods such as next\u2010generation sequencing, microfluidic assays, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2010associated\u2013based diagnostic testing have been adopted to enhance the diagnostic efficacy and sensitivity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection", ". 28 IgG antibody assay against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1 domain was developed as an alternative diagnostic test, albeit with varying accuracies depending on the assay used. 29 Overall, antibody tests for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have high specificity but relatively lower sensitivity, which varied with different immunoassays and epitopes. 30 Antigen testing is inexpensive, can provide results in a few minutes, and be performed at home. Population\u2010wide antigen testing was demonstrated to reduce the transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 31 Asymptomatic SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is associated with a longer duration of viral shedding and needs to be promptly detected to stop viral transmission. 32 , 33 The concentrations of neutrophil extracellular traps increase in the plasma, trachea aspirate, and lung autopsies and contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID\u201019. 34 , 35 Thus, blood neutrophil extracellular traps can be a potential biomarker for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection", ". In addition, asymptomatic patients have lower levels of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 specific IgG antibodies, which decay during the early convalescent phase. 32 Laboratory changes during COVID\u201019 have been reviewed and are summarized in our previous studies. 36 , 37 White blood cells, lymphopenia, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, high\u2010sensitivity C\u2010reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)\u20106, IL\u20101\u03b2, Krebs von den Lungen\u20106, and ferritin were identified as potential biomarkers for monitoring the progression and predicting the outcomes of COVID\u201019. 37 , 38 Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches have been developed to help select the most useful laboratory sets of laboratory findings to diagnose COVID\u201019 more efficiently. 39 One ML model was constructed based on laboratory parameters and chest CT scan to differentiate between COVID\u201019 and other viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and other pneumonia", ". 39 , 40 Another study trained several ML models using data on reported comorbidities, medications, symptoms, and laboratory parameters on hospital admission and over the disease course to rapidly identify SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive patients, high\u2010risk patients, and recognize longitudinal warning signs of a possible fatal outcome. 40 ML models, and likely together with artificial intelligence, may be helpful in the construction of decision tree of COVID\u201019 in the future.3. RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR SUSCEPTIBILITY, SEVERITY, AND MORTALITY OF COVID\u2010193.1. Protective factorsHealth systems resilience is critical for the control of the COVID\u201019 pandemic. 41 A healthy diet has been identified as a protective factor against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 36 Both the incidence rate and mortality of COVID\u201019 were lower in Bacillus Calmette\u2010Guerin (BCG)\u2010vaccinated countries than in those without vaccination program", ". 42 , 43 Moreover, BCG vaccination during early childhood seems to selectively protect against infection in the elderly. 44 BCG was suggested to enhance innate immune responses, leading to \u201ctrained immunity\u201d and confer protection against viral infections. 45 Similarly, recent administration of the mumps\u2010measles\u2010rubella vaccine was observed to be associated with a reduction in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in males 46 and severity of COVID\u201019, 47 although the real correlation between this vaccine and COVID\u201019 is still unclear. 48 Lower levels of nasal ACE2 49 and airway cathepsin L/CTSL1, 50 a protease that cleaves and primes the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein, may contribute to the mild disease of COVID\u201019 in children. Atopy and type 2 inflammation have been shown to be associated with a decreased expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells and thus lower susceptibility to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102", ". 51 Mechanistically, the type 2 cytokine IL\u201013 reduced ACE2 expression, 51 intracellular viral load, and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission, while increasing the cilial keratan sulfate coating in airway epithelial cells, suggesting a role of IL\u201013 in attenuating viral shedding and thus reducing the entry, replication, and spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 52 IL\u201013 in combination with mucus was shown to reduce SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA by 90%\u201397% after inoculation of this virus in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. 53 Another recent study in preprint also demonstrated that IL\u201013 decreased the expression of long ACE2 mRNA and reduced glycosylation of full\u2010length ACE2 protein, leading to reduction in the apical expression of ACE2 on the ciliated airway epithelial cells. 54 These data indicate that the inflammatory milieu may be an important factor affecting the expression of ACE2 and other SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010relevant receptors, and thus affect the susceptibility and infection", ". Genetic variation of allergic disease was associated with a lower risk of COVID\u201019. 55 Most studies suggested that AR and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are not associated with a higher risk of susceptibility and severity of COVID\u201019, 36 , 56 , 57 although reduced ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from patients with concomitant AR and allergic asthma. 51 The expression of ACE2 in nasal polyp tissues of patients with CRS was lower than that of healthy controls. 58 The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the olfactory mucosa was also lower patients of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) compared to healthy controls, and the protein expression of ACE2 was negatively correlated with eosinophils numbers in olfactory mucosa. 59 Moreover, the expression of ACE2 was upregulated by interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b3 and downregulated by type 2 cytokines in nasal epithelial cells", ". 51 , 60 , 61 On the other hand, another study showed that early Th2 inflammation and attenuated IFN\u2010\u03b3 production in the nose may indicate worse clinical outcomes. 62 Moreover, elevated IL\u201013 was associated with severe COVID\u201019, and this effect may be due to IL\u201013\u2010induced hyaluronan deposition in the lung. Treatment with dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL\u20104 and IL\u201013, was associated with less severe COVID\u201019, while IL\u201013 neutralization reduced hyaluronan deposition and disease severity and death in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013infected mice. 63 Based on the results of this study, a pilot phase IIA clinical trial observing the safety and efficacy of dupilumab on forty moderate or severe COVID\u201019 patients found that dupilumab did not increase the ventilator\u2010free survival at day 28, but it did reduce the mortality at day 60 when compared to placebo", ". 64 All these data suggest a complex association among type 2 inflammation, ACE2 expression, IL\u201013, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, and COVID\u201019 outcomes.The corticosteroid dexamethasone can increase ventilator\u2010free days 65 and reduce the death rate 66 in severe and critically ill COVID\u201019 patients. Mechanistically, dexamethasone treatment was shown to restrain neutrophil pathogenicity by reducing IFNactive\u2010neutrophils and expanding immunosuppressive immature neutrophils. 67 Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduced the level of ACE2 in induced sputum 68 from asthma patients and in bronchial epithelia from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. 69 Clinical studies reported that inhaled budesonide in COVID\u201019 patients reduced time to recovery and resulted in less severe outcome. 70 , 71 Thus, proper systemic and ICS treatment may benefit to COVID\u201019 patients", ". 70 , 71 Thus, proper systemic and ICS treatment may benefit to COVID\u201019 patients. Inhalable SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010specific siRNA and human ACE2\u2010containing nanocatchers were shown to reduce SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection 72 , 73 and lung inflammation, 72 as shown in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected mice.3.2. Risk factorsThe emergence of new variants of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, such as Omicron and its subvariants, present a challenge for the eradication of COVID\u201019 as they have evolved immune escape from the neutralizing antibodies developed in previous infections and vaccinations. 74 , 75 COVID\u201019 breakthrough infection associated with the new variants has become a major concern. 76 Whole genome sequencing revealed two distinct mechanisms that can predispose an individual to life\u2010threatening COVID\u201019, namely failure to control viral replication or an enhanced tendency toward pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation", ". 77 Older age, male sex, cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, racial/ethnic disparities, chronic kidney diseases, and cancer have been identified as risk factors for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and worse outcomes of COVID\u201019. 36 , 37 A recent meta\u2010analysis identified that obesity was associated with an increased risk of COVID\u201019\u2010related hospitalization and death, especially for those with extreme obesity. 78 Healthcare workers are at higher risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection compared to non\u2010healthcare workers. 37 , 79 Blood levels of neutrophil elastase 80 and histone\u2010DNA 81 were associated with severe, systemic, and multi\u2010organ manifestations of COVID\u201019. Higher levels of bacterial DNA in the system circulation were associated with severe and fatal COVID\u201019. 82 COVID\u201019 patients with inborn errors of immunity, except type I IFN immunity errors, exhibit an almost similar natural COVID\u201019 course compared to the general population", ". 83 Interestingly, individuals with blood group A are at higher risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and severe disease, whereas blood group O may be protective against COVID\u201019. 84 The higher expression of entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 increase the susceptibility to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 36 Smoking was associated with higher expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN, and BSG in bronchial brushes 9 and represents a risk factor for COVID\u201019 mortality when not adjusted for chronic respiratory diseases. 85 Air pollution has been shown to be associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and COVID\u201019 mortality. 86 Mechanistically, air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matters (PM) may disrupt the airway epithelial barrier and impair the defense against respiratory viruses. 86 , 87 The airway epithelial barrier interacts with the respiratory microbiome to shape the immune response in the lungs", ". 88 In addition, air pollution may contribute to chronic systemic inflammation and a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, which have been demonstrated to be risk factors for severe COVID\u201019. 87 , 89 , 90 Air pollution is also correlated with a higher expression of ACE2 receptor in the lung. 91 Furthermore, fine PMs such as PM2.5 and PM10 may act as carriers of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and promote the transmission of this virus. 89 Lockdown during COVID\u201019 was associated with a reduction in PM2.5 concentrations due to reduced traffic emission. 92 Interestingly, the concentrations of airborne pollen correlated with the infection rates of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in thirty\u2010one countries across both hemispheres. 93 This may be attributed to the impairment of innate antiviral immunity of airway epithelia upon pollen exposure", ". 93 The severity and excess death rate of COVID\u201019 in northern Italy were suggested to have a link with the increased air pollution, 87 in accordance with several other studies. 94 , 95 , 96 3.3. New variants of concernsNew variants of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 emerged sequentially, becoming the predominant strains during the pandemic. These variants have distinct ACE2 binding affinity, virulence, transmissibility, and host immune responses 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 , 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 , 108 , 109 (Figure 1). Currently, the most pronounced risk factor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is the emergence of new variants or subvariants that are resistant to neutralizing antibodies and with higher transmissibility. 110 The subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, most likely stem from Omicron lineage BA.2, 110 were first spotted in South Africa 108 , 110 and are now spreading to Europe, the United States, 111 and other regions worldwide", ". 112 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 belong to the single\u2010strand RNA (ssRNA) virus, like rhinovirus (RV) and influenza virus.

COVID\u201019 AND ASTHMAObservational studies indicate a potential protective factor of asthma for the morbidity and mortality of COVID\u201019, 1 , 56 although conflicting data from the United States and United Kingdom (UK) suggested a higher prevalence of asthma in COVID\u201019 patients. 131 A UK study found that asthmatic patients were associated with a higher risk of COVID\u201019. 132 For allergic asthma, the protective effects have been partly attributed to the antiviral effect of eosinophils, 36 whose beneficial effects on COVID\u201019 outcomes depend on ICS. 133 However, whether COVID\u201019 patients with asthma are at higher risk of long\u2010COVID symptoms is still unclear as there are contradictory research studies. 134 , 135 It remains unclear whether asthma is a risk factor for the severe and worse outcome of COVID\u201019.

However, it appears to be related to the asthma phenotypes, treatments, and severity. 136 , 137 Studies demonstrated that Th2\u2010high inflammation may be associated with reduced, while Th2\u2010low inflammation may be associated with increased risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and severity of COVID\u201019. 138 Asthma was shown to be associated with an increased hospitalization risk of COVID\u201019 both in adults 56 and in children. 139 Another study observed an increased hospitalization rate only in asthmatic patients needing regular ICS or regular/intermittent ICS with add\u2010on therapy. 132 The hospitalization rate of allergic asthmatics was 50% lower compared to non\u2010allergic asthmatics. 135 A recent meta\u2010analysis identified preexisting asthma as a risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU) admission among COVID\u201019 patients. 140 The heterogeneity of asthma endotypes (allergic vs. non\u2010allergic asthma) may underly the different disease course in these studies", ". non\u2010allergic asthma) may underly the different disease course in these studies. 36 , 135 Eosinopenia was associated with worse outcomes of COVID\u201019, including longer duration of hospitalization, higher severity, and mortality. 1 , 37 , 135 Dynamic monitoring of eosinophils counts in addition to other laboratory indices, such as neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocytes ratio lymphocytopenia and D\u2010dimer, may be used as predictive biomarkers of the outcomes of COVID\u201019. 36 , 37 Biologicals were associated with lower susceptibility in asthmatic patients. 141 Omalizumab\u2010augmented IFN\u2010\u03b1 production from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, 142 which may also contribute to the protecting effects of asthma against COVID\u201019.A lower expression of ACE2 in bronchial epithelial or lung tissue was observed in allergic asthmatic patients. 131 , 143 , 144 In addition, ICS may decrease the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in bronchial epithelia of asthmatic patients 68 and thus contribute to lower susceptibility to infection", ". A recent study in preprint showed that prior infection with rhinovirus restricted SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 replication, but co\u2010infection augmented retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene 1 (RIG\u20101) inflammasome activation and epithelial inflammation in patients with asthma, especially in the presence of house dust mites. 145 In a summary, the relationship between asthma, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and COVID\u201019 is complex and may be associated with the inflammatory phenotypes, treatments, and comorbidities. 146 5. LONG COVID\u201019A large number of patients recovering from COVID\u201019 may suffer from long\u2010term complications of COVID\u201019 including a large variety of symptoms, defined as \u201cpost\u2010acute COVID\u201019 syndrome\u201d or \u201clong COVID\u201019\u201d. 147 The symptoms of long COVID\u201019 are summarized in Table 2. The current evidence does not indicate an increased risk of long COVID\u201019 in asthmatic patients, although studies with more patients are warranted", ". 144 Mechanistically, long COVID\u201019 patients were characterized with over\u2010activated innate immune cells, lacked naive T and B cells, and showed persistent elevated expression of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03bb1 at 8 months after infection. 148 Mast cell activation may also contribute to long\u2010term COVID\u201019 as evidenced by persistent mediators release. 149 Activated inflammatory caspases can induce pyroptosis, which may partly contribute to lymphopenia in COVID\u201019, and the caspases inhibitors have been suggested to be potential therapeutics for severe and long COVID\u201019. 150 Preexisting and de novo autoantibodies were more frequently detected in hospitalized or severe COVID\u201019 patients and may play a role in post\u2010acute sequelae of COVID\u201019. 151 Dysregulated respiratory CD8+ T cell responses were associated with impaired lung function after acute COVID\u201019. 152 The mechanisms underlying COVID\u201019 are still not fully understood", ". 152 The mechanisms underlying COVID\u201019 are still not fully understood.

This schematic diagram shows the possible relevant factors contributing to long COVID\u201019. Persistent tissue damage and inflammation might be the major mechanisms of persistent symptoms of COVID\u201019. In addition, persistent dendritic cell deficiency, autoimmunity, and dysbiosis may also contribute to the long\u2010term symptoms. Severe disease, aging, and female are suggested as risk factors for the development of long COVID\u201019.6. IMMUNE RESPONSES AND PATHOGENESIS OF COVID\u201019The immunological pathogenicity of COVID\u201019 is complex and may be associated with the virulence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the lack of the temporal coordination between innate and adaptive immune responsces. 162 , 163 , 164 Other mechanisms such as pre\u2010existing immunity to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, superantigens, and autoimmunity have been also suggested to participate in the immune responses to this virus. 165 Adaptive responses to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 develop mainly to the spike protein", ". 165 Adaptive responses to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 develop mainly to the spike protein. It is postulated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA is sensed by toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u20103/7/8 and activates innate immune pathways. 154 , 166 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can also be recognized by RIG\u2010I, the cytoplasmic sensor of RNA. 167 , 168 The interaction of RIG\u20101 with viral genome directly abrogates viral replication in lung cells 167 ; on the contrary, the activation of RIG\u20101 by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 triggers the epithelial cells to release inflammatory mediators, which then stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation, especially in the presence of exogenous inflammatory stimuli. 168 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 replication induced a delayed type I IFN response in lung epithelial cells, which is regulated by melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA5). 169 Activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes participates in the pathophysiology of COVID\u201019 and is associated with the severity of the disease", ". 170 Type I IFN\u2010mediated antiviral responses and activation of both CD4+Th1 and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes result in viral clearance in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected subjects with mild symptoms. 171 Impairment in the number and function of dendritic cells may also lead to dysregulation in innate and adaptive immunity including antiviral response. 165 , 172 The insufficient antiviral response, 173 or autoantibodies against type I IFNs, 174 , 175 combined with the system inflammation induced by a large number of immune cells and resident tissue cells, may contribute to the cytokine storm in severe disease. 154 Virus\u2010specific IgM and IgA can be detected in the acute phase followed by an increase in virus\u2010specific IgG at a later stage of COVID\u201019. 165 More severe COVID\u201019 patients were associated with higher anti\u2010RBD IgA and IgG antibody responses when compared to those not hospitalized or asymptomatic. No deaths were reported in patients with higher an IgG antibody index (NT50/IgG >100)", ". No deaths were reported in patients with higher an IgG antibody index (NT50/IgG >100). 176 Dupilumab (anti\u2010IL\u20104/13 R\u03b1) used in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients with COVID\u201019 was associated with a lower IgG antibodies response. 177 Poor and delayed anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM and IgG antibodies responses correlated with poor outcomes of COVID\u201019 in children. 178 A visible antibody cross\u2010reactivity was reported in infectious bronchitis virus, a non\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and chicken aerosol vaccines particularly in highly exposed veterinarians who administered the vaccines. However, this immune cross\u2010reactivity did not show a viral neutralizing activity and focused on non\u2010RBD antibodies, which substantially differ between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and non\u2010SARS\u2010CoVs. 179 Mild COVID\u201019 patients exhibited SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010specific memory B and T cells responses that display hallmarks of antiviral immunity", ". 180 The antigen\u2010driven activation of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 memory B cells persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and may provide long\u2010term protection 181 Diverse autoantibody responses were identified in COVID\u201019 patients and were correlated with disease severity and duration of hospitalization. 175 7. MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC DISEASES DURING THE COVID\u201019 PANDEMICThe COVID\u201019 pandemic has shaped the ways medical services are conducted in order to accommodate for the imposed lockdown and social distancing measures. Accordingly, telemedicine was adopted by many physicians to guide the treatment and follow\u2010up of allergic patients. 182 Continuation of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) was suggested for AR patients with COVID\u201019 at the recommended doses. 183 Treatment with INCS before SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was associated with a lower risk of COVID\u201019\u2010related hospitalization, ICU admission, or death", ". 184 A systematic review assessed the use of INCS on the olfactory dysfunction of COVID\u201019 patients, but only identified a single study to include in the review. 185 The impact of INCS on the susceptibility and outcomes of COVID\u201019 is still inconclusive. 57 Oral corticosteroids, biologicals, and surgical treatment should be avoided or suspended in CRS patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 57 Telemedicine was advocated to replace in\u2010person visits for the care of CRS patients during the COVID\u201019 pandemic with high patient satisfaction. 186 Inhaled or oral corticosteroids should be continued to for asthmatic patients without SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection to maintain asthma control, and oral corticosteroids and biologicals should be continued to treat severe asthma exacerbations. 187 In the case of asthmatic patients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, the use of inhalers should be indicated over nebulizers for the delivery of aerosolized medications to avoid viral transmission via aerosol", ". 188 Current evidence suggests that treatment with biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation does not increase the risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and COVID\u201019 severity 138 and may have beneficial effects. 141 Therefore, biologicals may be continued during COVID\u201019 for asthmatic patients without SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) should be temporarily discontinued until recovery for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive asthmatic patients or in contact with confirmed cases of COVID\u201019. 189 AIT can be continued in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 negative confirmed patients but with a prolonged injection interval. 189 Switching from subcutaneous to sublingual immunotherapy may be considered for AIT during COVID\u201019. 190 Skin manifestations of COVID\u201019 may be similar to other viral infections and drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs). 191 , 192 The diagnosis and management of DHRs induced by medications repurposed and off\u2010label for the treatment of COVID\u201019 have been discussed in a few review papers", ". 191 , 192 , 193 Pulmonary function tests such as spirometry should be restricted to those patients with high clinical priority and using a high\u2010efficiency inline filter. The patients should be encouraged to perform peak expiratory flow measurement at home to reduce the possible transmission via small droplets and aerosol generated during the pulmonary function test. 194 , 195 Many studies have focused on the impact of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on the status and control of allergic diseases. In asthmatic children, environmental changes, altered medical practice, and medication use, changes in transportation and travel patterns, school attendance, and physical activity impacted asthma control during the pandemic. 196 A survey revealed that the majority of the AD patients experienced AD flares with mild worsening of the disease during the COVID\u201019 pandemic", ". 197 Dupilumab seems to be safe and crucial for a better outcome of COVID\u201019 and should be continued in AD patients during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. 198 During COVID\u201019, AIT was initiated and continued by most physicians in patients without indications of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. 199 In contrast, lockdown during COVID\u201019 resulted in decreased numbers of patients initiating AIT but without significant impact on sublingual immunotherapy. 200 COVID\u201019 was reported to increase the incidence of acute urticaria 201 and disease activity of chronic urticaria in males but not females, which may be associated with loss of omalizumab efficacy. 202 Single\u2010cell sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed that the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID\u201019 may promote the activation of monocytes/macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which may be involved in the development of maculopapular drug rash associated with COVID\u201019. 203 8", ". 203 8. COVID\u201019 VACCINESNatural SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection does not establish a strong antibody response that can prevent reinfection. 204 COVID\u201019 vaccines offer promising protective immunity against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Two groups of vaccines are available for the global vaccination strategy for COVID\u201019. The classic group includes subunit, inactivated, live\u2010attenuated, and virus\u2010like particle vaccines; novel approaches include RNA\u2010based vaccines, which deliver RNA coding target viral proteins into human cells. 205 Two mRNA\u2010based vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer\u2010BioNTech) and Moderna mRNA vaccines were approved with emergency use or conditioned marked authorization by the USA, European Union, and other countries\u2019 governmental agencies. Phase III clinical trials and real\u2010world data suggested that COVID\u201019 vaccines have dramatically reduced severe COVID\u201019 cases 206 and excess mortality due to COVID\u201019 (Figure 3), although breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated individuals is not uncommon", ". 207 Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Time\u2010series visualization of global daily reported COVID\u201019 deaths, excess mortality estimates, and vaccinations. Source data were downloaded from Our World in Data on August 19, 2022. Excess mortality estimates and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were modeled by the Economist. The lines indicate 7\u2010day rolling averages of daily reported deaths and excess mortality estimates per million people as well as all daily vaccination doses per billion people, including boosters that are counted individually.8.1. Efficacy and immune responses of COVID\u201019 vaccinesThe RBD of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies induced by COVID\u201019 vaccines. Specific IgG antibodies against conformational but not sequential RBD epitopes have the potential to block the binding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 with ACE2 and confer protective immunity", ". 208 Mutations in RBD, as identified in several VOC, display increased binding affinity to ACE2 209 and/or reduced neutralization ability of sera from convalescent and BNT162B2 vaccinated individuals. 210 , 211 , 212 , 213 Noticeably, BNT162b2\u2010induced IgG antibodies had higher avidity to mutated RBD than those induced by natural infection. 74 The variant Omicron exhibited approximately fourfold greater immune escape relative to the Beta variant. 212 Prior COVID\u201019 was associated with higher neutralization capacity for the ancestral virus after BNT162b2 vaccination. 212 More importantly, two doses of mRNA COVID\u201019 vaccines provided almost non\u2010existent, whereas a booster dose yielded almost 75% protection against symptomatic infection of Omicron. 213 It is predicted that BNT162b2 boosted, or vaccination (two doses) combined with the previous infection can prevent 73% symptomatic infection by Omicron, which is significantly higher than in individuals with BNT162b2 vaccination only", ". 212 Other types of vaccines have also been administered around the world. CVnCoV is a vaccine based on unmodified RNA and induced only a 48% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic disease. 214 CV2CoV is the second\u2010generation unmodified mRNA vaccine but with optimized non\u2010coding regions and enhanced antigen expression. Compared to CVnCoV, CV2CoV induced higher titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants, and memory B and T cell responses in non\u2010human primates. 215 The inactivated Sinopharm/BBIBP COVID\u201019 vaccine is widely used in developing countries including China due to its low storage requirements. Seroconversion rates in unexposed individuals after first and second dose reached 40% and 100%, respectively, and younger individuals and women had the highest antibody concentrations. Previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was associated with a strong antibody response after a single dose of the BBIBP vaccine", ". A sharp increase in antibody concentrations was observed following SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection after the first and second doses. 216 Virus\u2010like particle\u2010based COVID\u201019 vaccines induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and its variants in mice and rhesus macaques. 217 , 218 PreS\u2010RBD vaccine was developed based on a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the human hepatitis B virus\u2010derived PreS antigen and two SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD domains. It induced a robust anti\u2010RBD IgG response in rabbits consisting of an early IgG1 and sustained IgG4, which can be detected in serum and mucosa secretions. Moreover, the vaccine\u2010induced antibodies potently inhibited the interaction of RBD with ACE2 and possessed the neutralizing ability of the omicron VOC", ". 219 The efficacy and immune responses elicited by different types of COVID\u201019 vaccines are listed in Table 3.TABLE 3Efficacy and immune response of different SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 vaccinesVaccine nameTypes of vaccinesEfficacy and immune responsesBNT162b2mRNA vaccines 95% effective in preventing COVID\u201019Induced IgG antibodies had higher avidity to mutated RBD than those induced by natural infection 74 , 212 , 223 ModernamRNA vaccines 94.1% efficacy at preventing COVID\u201019Preclinical testing in advanced clinical evaluation has shown a Th1\u2010skewed vaccine response and no pathologic lung infiltrates 224 , 225 , 226 AZD1222Viral vector After the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime\u2010boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81.3% at \u226512 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55.1% at <6 weeks)Higher binding and neutralizing antibody titers in sera with a longer prime\u2010boost interval 227 Sputnik VViral vector 91.6% efficacious against COVID\u201019 (from day 21 after the", "interval 227 Sputnik VViral vector 91.6% efficacious against COVID\u201019 (from day 21 after the first dose, to the day of receiving the second dose)RBD\u2010specific IgG was detected in 98% of samples, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 8996, and a seroconversion rate of 98.25%Increased SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 neutralizing antibody titersBy day 28 after the first vaccination, all vaccinated participants had significantly higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion upon antigen restimulation compared with the day of administration of the first dose 228 Ad26.COV2.SViral vector The level of protection for the combined endpoints of moderate and severe disease varied: 72% in the United States; 66% in Latin American countries; and 57% in South Africa, 28 days post\u2010vaccination", ".

Recently, a diversity of animal experiments and clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the immune responses and the safety and efficacy of intranasal administration of COVID\u201019 vaccines, respectively. 220 It is hypothesized that intranasal vaccination may induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses, 221 and thus the local mucosal immunity may prevent the virus infection through the upper respiratory tract and block transmission to other people. 222 In mice, intranasal administration of virus\u2010based vaccine candidates expression SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein elicited robust specific IgG and IgA antibodies and polyfunctional S\u2010specific Th1\u2010skewed CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T\u2010cell immune responses. 221 Four COVID\u201019 mucosal vaccines have been approved as booster for the prevention of COVID\u201019 infection in China, Russia, India and Iran. 222 The exact efficacy of these mucosal vaccines is still unknown since no clinical trial data are released.8.2", ". Allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccinesLocal and systemic reactions were reported in phase III clinical trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV\u201019 vaccine, which were mostly mild and moderate in intensity. 241 Cutaneous adverse effects of the available COVID\u201019 vaccines include injection site reactions, urticaria, angioedema, exacerbation of atopic eczema, and systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. 242 Anaphylaxis to the BNT162b2 vaccine was reported several days after the initiation of public vaccinations. 243 Overall, the incidence of COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine\u2010associated anaphylaxis is very low, 244 with only was 4.8 per million doses for BNT162b2 and 5.1 per million doses for mRNA\u20101273 according to data from Vaccine Safety Datalink. 245 Moreover, the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a higher rate of systemic events", ". 245 Moreover, the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a higher rate of systemic events. 223 Nevertheless, the incidence of anaphylaxis\u2010associated with COVID\u201019 vaccines is comparable to that of other vaccines 246 and the benefits may outweigh the potential risks of COVID\u201019 vaccinations. 247 , 248 Unfortunately, the fear of an allergic reaction has caused vaccine hesitancy in the general public, haltering global vaccination efforts. 249 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an additive present in the Pfizer\u2010BioNtech and Moderna mRNA vaccines used to prevent premature degradation of the nanoparticless, 250 and it has been suggested to be the major culprit for anaphylaxis to COVID\u201019 vaccines. 251 PEG and its derivatives are also widely used in household products including toothpaste, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods", ". 252 Many types of vaccines, therapeutic medications, and diagnostic media contain PEG with different molecular weights and their risks of anaphylaxis have been previously reported. 252 , 253 Exposure to products containing PEG via intravenous and intramuscular injection is the major route causing HSR to PEG. There is a study showing that lipid\u2010conjugated PEG or PEGylated liposomes have a stronger immunogenicity than PEG alone and may contribute to the anaphylaxis elicited by COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccines. 254 , 255 Anti\u2010PEG IgE\u2010mediated HSR, complement activation\u2010related pseudoallergy induced by anti\u2010PEG IgM and IgG antibodies and potential interaction of PEG with mast cells and viral RNA have been suggested to underly COVID\u201019 vaccine anaphylaxis. 254 , 256 IgG and IgM antibodies against PEG were found in up to 25% of the population without known prior exposure to PEGylated products and in up to 89% of patients with known prior exposure to PEGylated products", ". 257 Other excipients than PEG present in authorized COVID\u201019 vaccines might also cause severe allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines and need appropriate allergological assessment. 258 EAACI suggested performing in vivo tests (skin prick test and intradermal test) and in vitro tests (basophil activation test, BAT) on the vaccines or their components in individuals with severe reactions to the first dose of COVID\u201019 vaccines. 259 The positive rate of skin test with PEG or mRNA vaccine in patients with reactions to COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine or with previous PEG or polysorbate allergies was very low. 260 , 261 Thus, the clinical significance of skin testing with mRNA vaccine in those with negative skin testing results with PEG is still unknown. BAT performed in patients with PEG allergy demonstrated that BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines and PEGylated lipids, but not unmodified PEG, can activate mast cells", ". 255 Thus, positive BAT results in mRNA vaccines may be a potential diagnostic tool for confirming HSR to PEG excipient.Studies have shown that most individuals with allergic reactions to the first dose tolerated well the second dose irrespective of the skin test results. 262 , 263 Thus, the second dose vaccine may be administered after careful evaluation and under careful monitoring in an allergy clinic. An EAACI position paper recommended that allergic patients without prior allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components and patients with mild and moderate allergies should not be excluded from COVID\u201019 vaccinations. 259 On the contrary, it would put population immunity with vaccination at risk due to the high prevalence of allergic diseases. 259 However, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease", ". Therefore, strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centers were provided in the EAACI statement to minimize the risk of allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. 259 Anaphylaxis induced by COVID\u201019 vaccines is rare but may be more severe in older people due to comorbidities and polypharmacy. 264 Intramuscular injection of adrenaline remains the first\u2010line therapy for anaphylaxis in older people. 264 Modified dosing or alternative vaccines were recommended by EAACI for those with confirmed reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. 259 Herein, we provide a flow chart for the treatment of allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines. This flow chart is modified based on EAACI recommendation and other consensus 259 , 265 , 266 (Figure 4).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4Flow chart for the management of individuals with allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccines", ". Allergic reactions to COVID\u201019 vaccine can be divided into immediate and late\u2010onset reactions according to the symptom onset time after injection. Premedication such as antihistamines can be used for those with immediate or late onset local reactions before the next dose of vaccine. Those with systemic symptoms are recommended to be assessed with skin test or basophil activation test (BAT) in an allergy clinic and then treated with premedication or alternative vaccines. 259 , 265 , 266 9. PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONSAnthropogenic activities, climate change, and global population movement set a perfect environment for new outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens. Using the knowledge and experience gained from the COVID\u201019 pandemic, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to predict and prevent the emergence and transmission of novel pathogens", ". 267 Effective surveillance of new SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants and reporting their transmissibility and rate of breakthrough infection is warranted to assist international policymaking. 268 The trajectory of COVID\u201019 needs to be closely monitored to further our understanding of the immunity waning, antigen drifting, and re\u2010entries from zoonotic reservoirs. 269 As we deepen our knowledge of COVID\u201019, vaccination strategies should be updated and revised, such as frequent administration of booster doses. The continuously mutating virus warrants the development of novel vaccines targeting current variant sequences. 270 The impacts of COVID\u201019 on allergen sensitization and the incidence of allergic disease are still unknown and need to be investigated by the society of allergy and clinical immunology.In conclusion, similarly to other respiratory viruses, full eradication of COVID\u201019 is not on the horizon", ". Novel strategies should be developed for the prevention and management of this disease, particularly for patients at high risk of severe disease and to prevent MIS\u2010C and long COVID. The emergence of new VOC and global vaccinations efforts have substantially changed the clinical and immunological profiles of COVID\u201019.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by Scientific Research Initiative Funds of Shanxi Bethune Hosital.CONFLICT OF INTERESTC.
