Headache features and timing of therapy were considered.Background: Headache is the most common symptom following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), affecting more than 80% of children and adolescents. It is unclear whether treatment for PTH should be tailored based on headache characteristics, particularly the presence of migraine features, and/or chronicity of the headache.Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases (1985\u20132021, limited to English) were performed, and key characteristics of included studies were entered into RedCAP\u00ae (Prospero ID CRD42020198703). Articles and conference abstracts that described randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, retrospective analyses, and case series were included. Participants included youth under 18 years of age with acute (<3 months) and persistent (\u22653 months) PTH. Studies that commented on headache improvement in response to therapy were included.Results: Twenty-seven unique studies met criteria for inclusion describing abortive pharmacologic therapies (9), preventative pharmacotherapies (5), neuromodulation (1), procedures (5), physical therapy and exercise (6), and behavioral therapy (2). Five RCTs were identified. Studies that focused on abortive pharmacotherapies were completed in the first 2 weeks post-mTBI, whereas other treatment modalities focused on outcomes 1 month to over 1-year post-injury. Few studies reported on migrainous features (7), personal history of migraine (7), or family history of migraine (3).Conclusions: There is limited evidence on the timing and types of therapies that are effective for treating PTH in the pediatric population. Prospective studies that account for headache characteristics and thoughtfully address the timing of therapies and outcome measurement are needed.Keywords: concussion, pediatric, posttraumatic headache, treatmentINTRODUCTIONHeadache is the most common symptom following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is reported by more than 80% percent of children and adolescents.1 Eight percent of children who have had head trauma will have headache that persists beyond 3 months,2 fulfilling International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria for persistent headache attributed to trauma or injury to the head and/or neck, here termed persistent PTH.3 Migraine is the most common phenotype of PTH in children and is seen in up to 55% of cases.4 Prior work in children suggests that PTH with migrainous features5\u20139 or a personal or family history of migraine is associated with prolonged recovery.5,6 The PTH \u201cmigraine phenotype\u201d may represent a subset of patients who would benefit from more directed headache management.9 This is of particular interest in the pediatric population due to the high incidence of migraine in the teenage years and early twenties.10 In this age group, individuals prone to developing migraine may not have exhibited symptoms yet and mTBI may act as a triggering event for migraine.11 Three reviews have focused on PTH treatment in the past decade.12\u201314 Although informative, only one looked exclusively at children,14 and none reported the presence of migrainous features.The objective of this review was to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, retrospective analyses, and case series of youth (<18 years) with acute or persistent PTH that assessed the effect of pharmacologic, procedural, and nonpharmacologic treatments on headache improvement. Headache characteristics, including presence of migrainous features, and the timing of therapies were evaluated when available. This review identifies gaps in knowledge regarding the management of pediatric PTH to help guide future treatment trials.METHODSThis systematic review preregistered protocol can be found on the Prospero database (ID CRD42020198703). PRISMA guidelines were followed,15 except in the subgrouping of results to streamline integrating results within multiple treatment categories. Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) at least 50% of subjects were younger than 18 years old, (2) acute (<3 months) and/or persistent (\u22653 months) PTH of any phenotype was evaluated, (3) headache treatment response was reported, (4) sample size was >1, (5) written in English, and (6) published between 1985 and 2021. Headache features and duration were considered. We included peer-reviewed studies of a broad range of research designs given the limited research on the treatment of pediatric PTH. Papers that solely discussed diagnosis, evaluation tools, epidemiology, return to play or return to learn but not treatment were excluded. Review and opinion articles were also excluded, but one reviewer examined references to screen for additional articles that met inclusion criteria.Our literature search strategy was designed to target four key concepts: (1) child and adolescent, (2) posttraumatic, (3) headache, and (4) treatment. Queries of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane review search engines were conducted on July 16, 2020 and May 3, 2021. Details of the search strategy can be found in the Appendix.After duplicates were removed, two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information from the abstract search was saved in a Microsoft Excel\u00ae spreadsheet, and software generated in Matlab\u00ae was used to identify duplicates. Two authors independently extracted data from the selected studies and entered it into REDCap\u00ae, an electronic data management program, and each article was assessed for quality. We integrated the data as a descriptive synthesis rather than a meta-analysis due to the limited studies available. Study design type, as well as checklists provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tools (https: //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/study-quality-assessment-tools), which were specific to study type, were used to rank the data as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d based on prior reports that have used this tool16 (Table 1).TABLE 1Data quality assessment definitionsData qualityType of evidenceGood Well-designed, well-executed randomized controlled trials Fair Randomized controlled trials with minor limitations including minor flaws in design or executionWell-designed, well-executed nonrandomized controlled studies, or observational studies Poor Randomized controlled trials with major limitationsNonrandomized intervention or observational studies with major limitationsUncontrolled clinical observations without comparison group (e.g., case series, case reports) Open in a separate windowDisagreements were reconciled by a third author. Data extraction included study information and characteristics, the therapeutic agent used, and outcomes assessed. Subject characteristics included headache features, family and personal history of migraine, details of treatment, and time from concussion to treatment were collected when available.The main outcome measure was improvement of headache. This was intentionally broad to capture as many articles as possible that comment on change in PTH related to an intervention. This included subjective improvement in headache, change in headache severity and/or frequency, improvement in migrainous features (i.e., photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), and headache-related disability.RESULTSOf the 3458 studies screened, 27 unique studies met criteria for final inclusion with a pooled sample size of 5036 participants (Figure 1). Seventeen of the studies (63%) included subjects that were 18 years old, with four of those (15%) including subjects older than 18. Therapeutic approaches were broadly characterized into abortive pharmacologic treatments, preventative pharmacologic treatments, procedures, neuromodulation, PT and exercise, and collaborative care and behavioral therapy (Table 2).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Flow chart of article identification and selectionTABLE 2Synopsis of findings from articles included in the systematic reviewFirst author (date)Study typeParticipant characteristicsTreatmentOutcomeData quality Abortive pharmacotherapies (oral) Petrelli et al.

Details can be found at https: //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/study-quality-assessment-tools.Abortive pharmacologic therapiesWe identified six peer-reviewed articles and three conference abstracts that evaluated the use of abortive pharmacologic therapies for the treatment of PTH. This included two prospective RCTs. Abortive treatments were typically administered within the first 2 weeks following mTBI. Both oral and intravenous (IV) therapies were studied. Studies were generally limited by small sample size, lack of comparator group, and retrospective design.Oral abortive therapies The best evidence comes from a prospective randomized open-label study assessing scheduled acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or both compared to standard of care started within the first week of mTBI to treat PTH. Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen resulted in the fewest number of headache days and highest return-to-school rate, followed by ibuprofen alone, then acetaminophen alone.17 Only median and range values were reported; no formal statistical significance testing was done.In contrast, a large retrospective cohort study found no difference in the rate of persistent PTH at 3 months in those who used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or triptans in the first 30 days compared to no treatment.18 In fact, those who used triptans developed persistent PTH at higher rates.18,19 A potential confounder is that subjects who used triptans may have had more significant headache and/or greater incidence of premorbid migraine, but this was not reported (NR). Additionally, medication doses and frequency were NR, and there was no metric for PTH severity at 3 months. Another study mentioned that triptans provided the most rapid relief for PTH, though more specific data were not included.20A case series reported two subjects who had marked improvement in PTH following a 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper within the first month of sustaining an mTBI.21 However, one subject required a more prolonged steroid taper due to headache recurrence, and many other co-agents were prescribed.The potential risks of overusing abortive headache therapies following mTBI were highlighted by a retrospective analysis of adolescents presenting to a headache clinic with persistent PTH. Seventy percent of participants in this cohort met criteria for medication overuse headache (MOH); among those, 68.5% had improvement in headache when over-the-counter analgesics and NSAIDs were discontinued.22 Notably, many of the subjects in this study were simultaneously receiving additional headache preventative pharmacologic treatments that may have impacted outcomes.Intravenous abortive therapies One small, RCT provided fair evidence that 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) was significantly more effective at decreasing headache severity than normal saline (NS) in youth with acute PTH immediately and 2\u20133 days after treatment.23 This study benefited from a randomized design and a standardized pain scale, but it did not specify the acuity of the mTBI, the follow-up period was short, and the study was stopped early due to challenges with recruitment.A subanalysis of a prospective cohort compared a single dose of IV metoclopramide given in the emergency department (ED) within 48 h of mTBI to no treatment. They found that IV metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of PTH at 1 and 4 weeks.24 This study was unique because it looked at the impact ofabortive treatment on long-term headache outcome. However, dosing was NR, treatment was not randomized, and only a very small percentage (3%) were given metoclopramide; it is therefore possible that those with more severe headache at onset were treated.A retrospective analysis of children \u226414 days of their mTBI who received IV fluids with either IV antiemetics (prochlorperazine or metoclopramide), IV ketorolac, or both found that most participants (80%\u201393%) experienced a >50% reduction in headache severity immediately following administration.25 This study was limited by its retrospective design, unreported medication dosages, and lack of long-term outcomes.Similarly, a retrospective chart review of an outpatient infusion center found that a single infusion of IV ketorolac, prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and NS improved headache in 85% of participants.26 However, this study was limited by retrospective design, undefined mean mTBI duration and follow-up period, small sample size, and unreported dosages.In summary, oral and IV abortive therapies administered within the first days following mTBI may offer immediate relief for PTH. Fair evidence supports alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the first week,17 as well as greater efficacy of HTS than NS in alleviating acute PTH.23 Two studies provided poor evidence for acute benefit of IV medications commonly used to treat migraine.25,26 In contrast, studies that looked at long-term (>1 week) effects did not find a benefit of NSAIDs, triptans,18,19 or IV metoclopramide24 for PTH. It is unclear whether abortive therapies can change the long-term trajectory of headaches following mTBI and whether MOH impacts likelihood of persistent PTH.22Preventative pharmacologic therapiesFive studies have reported on the effectiveness of preventative migraine medications in children with PTH.27 Quality of evidence was rated as poor for all studies.One cohort study evaluated children with PTH who were prescribed different preventative medications for headache for a mean duration of 5.5 weeks. Full treatment response was defined as \u226550% reduction in headache frequency with functional improvement, which was met by 64% of the cohort across all medications; 45% reported headache resolution. Full response occurred in 13/18 prescribed amitriptyline, 1/11 prescribed nortriptyline, 5/8 prescribed flunarizine, 0/6 prescribed topiramate, 9/12 prescribed melatonin, and 2/2 prescribed indomethacin (both with stabbing headache). Limitations of this study include presence of active co-interventions and lack of clarity regarding timing of medication initiation and timing of assessment.A second retrospective cohort study reported on children with persistent PTH treated with a preventative medication. Positive response to treatment was defined as \u226550% reduction in headache frequency, which was achieved by 10/20 patients overall. Positive response was reported by 4/11 of those prescribed amitriptyline, 3/6 prescribed propranolol, and 3/3 prescribed topiramate. Limitations of this study include unspecified time of initiation of medication and follow-up timing, as well as lack of specification of medication dosing.Bramley et al. reported on the efficacy of amitriptyline in a subset of adolescents evaluated in a concussion clinic.28 Participants with PTH \u2265 1 month were started on amitriptyline for headache prevention. Headache improvement was reported by 56/68 patients (82%) at a median of 4.4 months. Side effects were reported by 16/68 (23%). Females were more likely than males to report PTH (90% vs. 79%; p = 0.004) and were more likely to be prescribed amitriptyline (24% vs. 13%; p = 0.004).Mackie and Kirkham29 reported on PTH treatment in children presenting to a neurology clinic; 71% of patients had a migrainous phenotype. All patients received school accommodations, and 16 were treated with topiramate. Eighty-four percent of participants in the cohort overall reported headache improvement; of those treated with topiramate, 12/16 reported reduction in frequency and severity of migrainous headache. Limitations of this study include unspecified time of initiation of medication and timing of follow-up. Additionally, there were limited comparisons between those treated with topiramate compared with those treated with headache accommodations only.One case series reported on six children who were diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri following mTBI.30,31 Initiation of acetazolamide resulted in resolution of headache in 5/6 patients; the one case that did not respond was found to have craniosynostosis. In three cases, acetazolamide was used in combination with topiramate when topiramate alone was not effective. Patients were initially treated with other medications including amitriptyline, propranolol, and cyproheptadine for presumed PTH with no or incomplete response. The study was limited because not all patients met diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cererbri,32 and it was difficult to ascertain whether pseudotumor cerebri was secondary to PTH given range of time to diagnosis.In summary, data on preventative medication efficacy in PTH are limited by poor quality of evidence with reliance on retrospective data collection. The most evaluated medication was amitriptyline, with positive responses reported in 36%\u201382% of patients across three studies. Topiramate use was also described in three studies, but small numbers of patients resulted in variable efficacy outcomes, with response reported as 0%, 75%, and 100%. Notably, amitriptyline and topiramate were found to be ineffective as monotherapy in patients subsequently found to have intracranial hypertension following mTBI, highlighting the importance of identifying headache phenotype or underlying headache syndrome when treating PTH. While several studies reported on the presence of migrainous headache prior to or following mTBI, none evaluated its impact on treatment outcomes.NeuromodulationOne retrospective study showed that transcranial direct current stimulation reduced headache frequency and severity in children with PTH. Over half reported headache resolution.33 This study benefited from clearly defined metrics of headache improvement but was limited by the lack of comparison group, small sample size, and inconsistent number of treatment sessions used.ProceduresOccipital nerve block Three retrospective case series reported PTH improvement following occipital nerve blocks. All were limited by small sample size, concomitant therapies, variable number of nerve blocks administered, and lack of comparator group. One study found that nerve blocks were effective at treating youth with acute or persistent PTH, many of whom reported migrainous headache and a personal and/or family history of migraine. In this cohort, 71% of occipital nerve blocks resulted in headache resolution immediately, and 93% of subjects reported a good therapeutic effect defined as >24 h pain reduction or repeat nerve block request.34 A smaller retrospective study also found benefit of greater occipital nerve blocks to treat adolescents with PTH; in this cohort, 6/15 patients had occipital neuralgia and 8/15 had occipital tenderness on exam. Nerve blocks were effective in reducing headache frequency with 9/15 participants reporting a \u226550% reduction,35 although time to follow-up was not clear. Finally, a case series described three patients with posttraumatic occipital neuralgia who reported complete but temporary benefit (days) of occipital nerve blocks.36Acupuncture One case series reported on three youth with PTH who reported a reduction in headache severity following multiple acupuncture sessions.37 The study is limited by the small case series design and concomitant use of other therapies for PTH in all three subjects.In summary, there is consistent evidence that occipital nerve blocks may be helpful for treating PTH in youth, but evidence is limited by small sample sizes and lack of comparator groups. Very limited data suggest acupuncture may also be helpful.Physical therapy and exerciseWe identified six studies (three prospective,38\u201340 three retrospective41\u201343) that evaluated PT and timing of increased activity on PTH in youth. Some reported headache improvement, whereas others found modest or no effect.Physical therapy A small prospective RCT of youth with postconcussion symptoms compared cervical spine and vestibular physical rehabilitation to standard of care. Both groups worked with a physiotherapist for 8 weeks or until medical clearance. Eleven of fifteen participants in the intervention group were medically cleared to return to sport versus 1/14 in the control group. None of the medically cleared patients reported persistent headache, although there was no significant difference in the reduction of headache symptom scores between those who were cleared or not cleared in either group.38 Conclusions for this study are limited by small sample size, and most comparisons that were made were between those who were cleared or not cleared for sports, not intervention versus standard of care. Retrospective analysis of a large prospective cohort provided fair evidence that a 4-week active rehabilitation intervention improved headache and postconcussion symptom scores for youth with persistent symptoms at 4 weeks post-injury.41 A small retrospective cohort study looking at the impact of PT, cardiovascular exercise, vestibular and oculomotor exercise, cervicothoracic manual therapy, and sports-specific training on postconcussion symptoms persisting beyond 3 weeks found a modest decrease in headache severity following intervention over 7 days to up to 6 months, though significance testing was not done. They did find a significant reduction in postconcussion symptoms overall (mean total symptom score pre-intervention 18.2 vs. post-intervention 9.1 p < 0.01).42Exercise A pilot, prospective RCT compared those who participated in a subsymptom threshold exercise program to a control group of youth who had sustained a concussion and were at least 4 weeks post-injury. Following intervention, both groups reported a higher percentage with mild or no headache. There was a significant effect in the intervention group when total postconcussion symptoms scores were evaluated, but significance testing comparing headache outcomes in the two groups was NR.39 A prospective study found that completing diagnostic exertional testing did not significantly reduce headache symptom scores 24 h after testing. This study was limited by a high drop-out rate (31%).40 One retrospective study looked at the impact of early physical activity (<3 weeks following mTBI) on the presence of PTH at the initial follow-up visit and found that those who did not report early physical activity were significantly more likely to report headache.43 Interpretation of this study is limited by the possibility that those who did not report early physical activity may have been experiencing more significant and more debilitating postconcussion symptoms at onset.In summary, there is poor to fair evidence to support physical and exercise therapy as a treatment for PTH, although not all studies reported a benefit. Notably, most studies were designed to look at postconcussion symptoms overall and not headache specifically.Collaborative care, cognitive behavioral therapy, and biofeedbackA large prospective RCT reported that collaborative care including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), care management, and medication consultation as needed significantly improved patient satisfaction and postconcussion symptoms compared to standard of care. However, there was no significant improvement in PTH,44 and details about medication used and for what purpose were not described.Another retrospective analysis evaluated biofeedback as a treatment for PTH in youth. Forty-six percent of the cohort reported an improvement in PTH, with 35% reporting reduced frequency and 23% reporting reduced severity. Participants who reported a decrease in headache severity or frequency following biofeedback were less likely to be on antidepressant medications and more likely to have stayed in school compared to those who did not respond.45 Sample size was NR and use of concomitant therapies limits interpretation.In summary, collaborative care including CBT was shown to improve overall quality of life and postconcussion symptoms but did not specifically improve headache outcomes.44 There is limited support for biofeedback improving PTH.Headache risk factors and characteristicsOf 27 studies, 7 reported headache with migrainous features,6,17,21,29,34,35,46 7 reported on premorbid migraine history,6,22,24,25,35,39,42 and 3 reported on migraine family history.6,24,34 When reported, the frequency of headache was high, with 61%\u201387% of patients described as having daily or constant headache.6,22,24,35,45 When considered as a confounding variable, presence of prior headache history appeared to impact treatment outcomes,24,41 although this was not consistent across studies.25Four retrospective studies (all poor data quality) reported targeted treatments to headache phenotype. One study evaluating the efficacy of topiramate as a preventative specifically commented on reduction of \u201cmigrainous\u201d headaches.29 Two patients with stabbing headache were effectively treated with indomethacin.47 Case series that reported on posttraumatic occipital neuralgia36 and posttraumatic pseudotumor cerebri30,31 reported high response rates to targeted treatment.Timing of therapiesMost abortive pharmacologic therapies were studied between 48 h and 14 days after mTBI, and their efficacy was measured immediately to days after treatment. All other treatment modalities were studied in youth with at least 3\u20134 weeks of persistent symptoms. In some cases, symptoms were persistent for >1 year. The duration of preventative pharmacologic treatment, when reported, ranged from 5.5 weeks to 4 months on average.DISCUSSIONWe did not identify any studies that provided good quality evidence for treatment of PTH in children and adolescents. This finding is unchanged from systematic reviews of pharmacologic and procedural PTH treatment in adults and children,12,13 and from a review of postconcussive symptoms including headache.14 We expanded on this work by focusing specifically on headache in the pediatric population, including a broader range of treatments, and assessing for the presence of migrainous headache features and/or family and personal history of migraine in the reviewed studies. Limitations of the study design include that the searches were limited to identifying articles in English that were published in 1985 or later.Treatments that have been studied include abortive and preventative medications, procedures, neuromodulation, PT, exercise, collaborative care models, and behavioral therapies. There were two RCTs that supported the use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen17 and IV HTS23 in acute PTH. Overall evidence for preventative therapies was significantly limited by small sample sizes and lack of comparator groups. There was poor, but consistent evidence to support the use of occipital nerve blocks to treat acute and persistent PTH; however, sample sizes were small, and lacked appropriate comparator groups. The greatest number of prospective studies with comparator groups focused on nonpharmacologic strategies used to treat postconcussive symptoms including PT, exercise therapy, and collaborative care models. However, in most cases, headache was not the primary outcome, but rather one of multiple postconcussion symptoms being measured on an inventory. Further research is needed to assess the specific impact of these therapies on PTH.Defining headache characteristics following mTBIAlthough PTH is considered its own entity,3 there has been an effort to identify features of other primary and secondary headache disorders in PTH. A predisposition to migraine appears to act as a catalyst for PTH development,48 and some cases of PTH may be the abrupt onset of trauma-triggered migraine.11 A recent prospective multi-center cohort study demonstrated that those reporting migrainous headache <8 weeks post-mTBI were more likely to have a prolonged recovery, and were more likely to be prescribed preventative migraine medication.9 The authors proposed that migraine phenotype may represent a target for early intervention. We found that while many studies evaluated migraine-directed therapies, relatively few studies specifically reported on the presence of migrainous headache features and/or family or personal history of migraine. Studies that did target specific headache phenotypes reported high efficacy rates, although these were notably limited by small sample size and study design.The severity and frequency of PTH may also impact the efficacy of treatments. Chan et al. found that subjects who had a head CT in the ED were more likely to not respond to a combination of IV abortive therapies,25 with need for CT as a potential surrogate for symptom severity. While relatively few studies reported the presence of constant or daily PTH, this is a particularly critical group to focus efforts on due to high disease burden.Acute versus persistent PTHThere was variability in the definition of persistent symptoms and the timing of preventative therapy initiation with 1 and 3 months being the most common cutoffs. This likely stems from different definitions of \u201cpersistent\u201d in the mTBI literature, which range from 2 weeks up to 3 months.49 ICHD-3 criteria define persistent PTH as >3 months.3 Expert opinion has suggested that early treatment with preventative medications may be able to prevent the development of persistent PTH.50 However, there is no clear evidence-based determination of when it is most appropriate to switch focus from abortive to preventative pharmacologic therapies based on the results of this current review.Considerations for future clinical trial designWe propose the following recommendations based on our review: There is a need to establish standardized and validated metrics to measure headache improvement in PTH. Although guidelines to determine the efficacy of abortive therapies in children with migraine have not been established, in adults, the International Headache Society (IHS) recommendation for measuring pain resolution at 2 h as a primary endpoint and change in 4-point severity scale as a secondary endpoint51 would also be relevant for PTH. In children, the IHS recommends measuring the efficacy of preventative therapies as the change in total headache days/month.52 Measuring the number of severe headache days/month in addition may more effectively capture improvement for individuals with continuous headache. The PedMIDAS53 should be used as a metric of headache-related disability, which has been validated for time intervals as short as 1 month.54Consensus is needed on what constitutes persistent symptoms for research studies and when to start preventative therapies. We propose defining persistent symptoms as 4 weeks or longer. Consensus is that symptoms persisting past the acute period (defined as 4 weeks for school-age children) usually do not have a single etiology, but rather involve a complex interplay between multiple biopsychosocial factors leading to a more complicated recovery.55 This definition diverges from the ICHD-3 criteria for persistent PTH3 but would encourage early headache intervention to prevent the development of prolonged symptoms.50Risk factors for prolonged recovery including family and personal history of migraine, and the presence of migrainous features with headache shortly after mTBI should be reported and taken into consideration in both research studies and clinical management of PTH.5,6,9Headache characteristics, including the presence of MOH, should be considered when choosing the most appropriate treatment. ICHD-3 criteria3 can be used to identify the characteristics and/or presence of other headache disorders following mTBI. Research is needed to understand whether mTBI can provoke other primary or secondary headache disorders and establish potential shared pathophysiologic mechanisms.CONCLUSIONThere is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the timing and types of therapies that are effective for treating PTH. Well-designed prospective studies with appropriate sample size and comparator groups that include thoughtful approaches to headache features, and timing of therapies are needed.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to thank Maylene Qiu of the University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Library Systematic Review Service who provided us support in the design of the search strategy for this protocol.CONFLIC T OF INTERESTCPG: Dr. Patterson Gentile has received grant support through the American Academy of Neurology Clinical Research Training Scholarship and the International Headache Academy Research Award.

Headache features and timing of therapy were considered.Background: Headache is the most common symptom following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), affecting more than 80% of children and adolescents", ". It is unclear whether treatment for PTH should be tailored based on headache characteristics, particularly the presence of migraine features, and/or chronicity of the headache.Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases (1985\u20132021, limited to English) were performed, and key characteristics of included studies were entered into RedCAP\u00ae (Prospero ID CRD42020198703). Articles and conference abstracts that described randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, retrospective analyses, and case series were included. Participants included youth under 18 years of age with acute (<3 months) and persistent (\u22653 months) PTH", ". Studies that commented on headache improvement in response to therapy were included.Results: Twenty-seven unique studies met criteria for inclusion describing abortive pharmacologic therapies (9), preventative pharmacotherapies (5), neuromodulation (1), procedures (5), physical therapy and exercise (6), and behavioral therapy (2). Five RCTs were identified. Studies that focused on abortive pharmacotherapies were completed in the first 2 weeks post-mTBI, whereas other treatment modalities focused on outcomes 1 month to over 1-year post-injury. Few studies reported on migrainous features (7), personal history of migraine (7), or family history of migraine (3).Conclusions: There is limited evidence on the timing and types of therapies that are effective for treating PTH in the pediatric population", ". Prospective studies that account for headache characteristics and thoughtfully address the timing of therapies and outcome measurement are needed.Keywords: concussion, pediatric, posttraumatic headache, treatmentINTRODUCTIONHeadache is the most common symptom following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)", ". Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is reported by more than 80% percent of children and adolescents.1 Eight percent of children who have had head trauma will have headache that persists beyond 3 months,2 fulfilling International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria for persistent headache attributed to trauma or injury to the head and/or neck, here termed persistent PTH.3 Migraine is the most common phenotype of PTH in children and is seen in up to 55% of cases.4 Prior work in children suggests that PTH with migrainous features5\u20139 or a personal or family history of migraine is associated with prolonged recovery.5,6 The PTH \u201cmigraine phenotype\u201d may represent a subset of patients who would benefit from more directed headache management.9 This is of particular interest in the pediatric population due to the high incidence of migraine in the teenage years and early twenties.10 In this age group, individuals prone to developing migraine may not have exhibited", "twenties.10 In this age group, individuals prone to developing migraine may not have exhibited symptoms yet and mTBI may act as a triggering event for migraine.11 Three reviews have focused on PTH treatment in the past decade.12\u201314 Although informative, only one looked exclusively at children,14 and none reported the presence of migrainous features.The objective of this review was to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, retrospective analyses, and case series of youth (<18 years) with acute or persistent PTH that assessed the effect of pharmacologic, procedural, and nonpharmacologic treatments on headache improvement", ". Headache characteristics, including presence of migrainous features, and the timing of therapies were evaluated when available. This review identifies gaps in knowledge regarding the management of pediatric PTH to help guide future treatment trials.METHODSThis systematic review preregistered protocol can be found on the Prospero database (ID CRD42020198703). PRISMA guidelines were followed,15 except in the subgrouping of results to streamline integrating results within multiple treatment categories. Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) at least 50% of subjects were younger than 18 years old, (2) acute (<3 months) and/or persistent (\u22653 months) PTH of any phenotype was evaluated, (3) headache treatment response was reported, (4) sample size was >1, (5) written in English, and (6) published between 1985 and 2021. Headache features and duration were considered", ". Headache features and duration were considered. We included peer-reviewed studies of a broad range of research designs given the limited research on the treatment of pediatric PTH. Papers that solely discussed diagnosis, evaluation tools, epidemiology, return to play or return to learn but not treatment were excluded. Review and opinion articles were also excluded, but one reviewer examined references to screen for additional articles that met inclusion criteria.Our literature search strategy was designed to target four key concepts: (1) child and adolescent, (2) posttraumatic, (3) headache, and (4) treatment. Queries of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane review search engines were conducted on July 16, 2020 and May 3, 2021. Details of the search strategy can be found in the Appendix.After duplicates were removed, two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results for the inclusion and exclusion criteria", ". Information from the abstract search was saved in a Microsoft Excel\u00ae spreadsheet, and software generated in Matlab\u00ae was used to identify duplicates. Two authors independently extracted data from the selected studies and entered it into REDCap\u00ae, an electronic data management program, and each article was assessed for quality. We integrated the data as a descriptive synthesis rather than a meta-analysis due to the limited studies available", ". Study design type, as well as checklists provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tools (https: //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/study-quality-assessment-tools), which were specific to study type, were used to rank the data as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d based on prior reports that have used this tool16 (Table 1).TABLE 1Data quality assessment definitionsData qualityType of evidenceGood Well-designed, well-executed randomized controlled trials Fair Randomized controlled trials with minor limitations including minor flaws in design or executionWell-designed, well-executed nonrandomized controlled studies, or observational studies Poor Randomized controlled trials with major limitationsNonrandomized intervention or observational studies with major limitationsUncontrolled clinical observations without comparison group (e.g., case series, case reports) Open in a separate windowDisagreements were reconciled by a third author", ". Data extraction included study information and characteristics, the therapeutic agent used, and outcomes assessed. Subject characteristics included headache features, family and personal history of migraine, details of treatment, and time from concussion to treatment were collected when available.The main outcome measure was improvement of headache. This was intentionally broad to capture as many articles as possible that comment on change in PTH related to an intervention. This included subjective improvement in headache, change in headache severity and/or frequency, improvement in migrainous features (i.e., photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), and headache-related disability.RESULTSOf the 3458 studies screened, 27 unique studies met criteria for final inclusion with a pooled sample size of 5036 participants (Figure 1). Seventeen of the studies (63%) included subjects that were 18 years old, with four of those (15%) including subjects older than 18", ". Therapeutic approaches were broadly characterized into abortive pharmacologic treatments, preventative pharmacologic treatments, procedures, neuromodulation, PT and exercise, and collaborative care and behavioral therapy (Table 2).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Flow chart of article identification and selectionTABLE 2Synopsis of findings from articles included in the systematic reviewFirst author (date)Study typeParticipant characteristicsTreatmentOutcomeData quality Abortive pharmacotherapies (oral) Petrelli et al", ".

Details can be found at https: //www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/study-quality-assessment-tools.Abortive pharmacologic therapiesWe identified six peer-reviewed articles and three conference abstracts that evaluated the use of abortive pharmacologic therapies for the treatment of PTH. This included two prospective RCTs. Abortive treatments were typically administered within the first 2 weeks following mTBI. Both oral and intravenous (IV) therapies were studied. Studies were generally limited by small sample size, lack of comparator group, and retrospective design.Oral abortive therapies The best evidence comes from a prospective randomized open-label study assessing scheduled acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or both compared to standard of care started within the first week of mTBI to treat PTH", ". Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen resulted in the fewest number of headache days and highest return-to-school rate, followed by ibuprofen alone, then acetaminophen alone.17 Only median and range values were reported; no formal statistical significance testing was done.In contrast, a large retrospective cohort study found no difference in the rate of persistent PTH at 3 months in those who used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or triptans in the first 30 days compared to no treatment.18 In fact, those who used triptans developed persistent PTH at higher rates.18,19 A potential confounder is that subjects who used triptans may have had more significant headache and/or greater incidence of premorbid migraine, but this was not reported (NR). Additionally, medication doses and frequency were NR, and there was no metric for PTH severity at 3 months", ". Another study mentioned that triptans provided the most rapid relief for PTH, though more specific data were not included.20A case series reported two subjects who had marked improvement in PTH following a 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper within the first month of sustaining an mTBI.21 However, one subject required a more prolonged steroid taper due to headache recurrence, and many other co-agents were prescribed.The potential risks of overusing abortive headache therapies following mTBI were highlighted by a retrospective analysis of adolescents presenting to a headache clinic with persistent PTH", ". Seventy percent of participants in this cohort met criteria for medication overuse headache (MOH); among those, 68.5% had improvement in headache when over-the-counter analgesics and NSAIDs were discontinued.22 Notably, many of the subjects in this study were simultaneously receiving additional headache preventative pharmacologic treatments that may have impacted outcomes.Intravenous abortive therapies One small, RCT provided fair evidence that 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) was significantly more effective at decreasing headache severity than normal saline (NS) in youth with acute PTH immediately and 2\u20133 days after treatment.23 This study benefited from a randomized design and a standardized pain scale, but it did not specify the acuity of the mTBI, the follow-up period was short, and the study was stopped early due to challenges with recruitment.A subanalysis of a prospective cohort compared a single dose of IV metoclopramide given in the emergency department (ED) within 48 h of mTBI", "a single dose of IV metoclopramide given in the emergency department (ED) within 48 h of mTBI to no treatment", ". They found that IV metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of PTH at 1 and 4 weeks.24 This study was unique because it looked at the impact ofabortive treatment on long-term headache outcome", ". However, dosing was NR, treatment was not randomized, and only a very small percentage (3%) were given metoclopramide; it is therefore possible that those with more severe headache at onset were treated.A retrospective analysis of children \u226414 days of their mTBI who received IV fluids with either IV antiemetics (prochlorperazine or metoclopramide), IV ketorolac, or both found that most participants (80%\u201393%) experienced a >50% reduction in headache severity immediately following administration.25 This study was limited by its retrospective design, unreported medication dosages, and lack of long-term outcomes.Similarly, a retrospective chart review of an outpatient infusion center found that a single infusion of IV ketorolac, prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and NS improved headache in 85% of participants.26 However, this study was limited by retrospective design, undefined mean mTBI duration and follow-up period, small sample size, and unreported dosages.In summary, oral and IV", "duration and follow-up period, small sample size, and unreported dosages.In summary, oral and IV abortive therapies administered within the first days following mTBI may offer immediate relief for PTH", ". Fair evidence supports alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the first week,17 as well as greater efficacy of HTS than NS in alleviating acute PTH.23 Two studies provided poor evidence for acute benefit of IV medications commonly used to treat migraine.25,26 In contrast, studies that looked at long-term (>1 week) effects did not find a benefit of NSAIDs, triptans,18,19 or IV metoclopramide24 for PTH. It is unclear whether abortive therapies can change the long-term trajectory of headaches following mTBI and whether MOH impacts likelihood of persistent PTH.22Preventative pharmacologic therapiesFive studies have reported on the effectiveness of preventative migraine medications in children with PTH.27 Quality of evidence was rated as poor for all studies.One cohort study evaluated children with PTH who were prescribed different preventative medications for headache for a mean duration of 5.5 weeks", ". Full treatment response was defined as \u226550% reduction in headache frequency with functional improvement, which was met by 64% of the cohort across all medications; 45% reported headache resolution. Full response occurred in 13/18 prescribed amitriptyline, 1/11 prescribed nortriptyline, 5/8 prescribed flunarizine, 0/6 prescribed topiramate, 9/12 prescribed melatonin, and 2/2 prescribed indomethacin (both with stabbing headache). Limitations of this study include presence of active co-interventions and lack of clarity regarding timing of medication initiation and timing of assessment.A second retrospective cohort study reported on children with persistent PTH treated with a preventative medication. Positive response to treatment was defined as \u226550% reduction in headache frequency, which was achieved by 10/20 patients overall. Positive response was reported by 4/11 of those prescribed amitriptyline, 3/6 prescribed propranolol, and 3/3 prescribed topiramate", ". Limitations of this study include unspecified time of initiation of medication and follow-up timing, as well as lack of specification of medication dosing.Bramley et al. reported on the efficacy of amitriptyline in a subset of adolescents evaluated in a concussion clinic.28 Participants with PTH \u2265 1 month were started on amitriptyline for headache prevention. Headache improvement was reported by 56/68 patients (82%) at a median of 4.4 months. Side effects were reported by 16/68 (23%). Females were more likely than males to report PTH (90% vs. 79%; p = 0.004) and were more likely to be prescribed amitriptyline (24% vs. 13%; p = 0.004).Mackie and Kirkham29 reported on PTH treatment in children presenting to a neurology clinic; 71% of patients had a migrainous phenotype. All patients received school accommodations, and 16 were treated with topiramate", ". All patients received school accommodations, and 16 were treated with topiramate. Eighty-four percent of participants in the cohort overall reported headache improvement; of those treated with topiramate, 12/16 reported reduction in frequency and severity of migrainous headache. Limitations of this study include unspecified time of initiation of medication and timing of follow-up. Additionally, there were limited comparisons between those treated with topiramate compared with those treated with headache accommodations only.One case series reported on six children who were diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri following mTBI.30,31 Initiation of acetazolamide resulted in resolution of headache in 5/6 patients; the one case that did not respond was found to have craniosynostosis. In three cases, acetazolamide was used in combination with topiramate when topiramate alone was not effective", ". Patients were initially treated with other medications including amitriptyline, propranolol, and cyproheptadine for presumed PTH with no or incomplete response. The study was limited because not all patients met diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cererbri,32 and it was difficult to ascertain whether pseudotumor cerebri was secondary to PTH given range of time to diagnosis.In summary, data on preventative medication efficacy in PTH are limited by poor quality of evidence with reliance on retrospective data collection. The most evaluated medication was amitriptyline, with positive responses reported in 36%\u201382% of patients across three studies. Topiramate use was also described in three studies, but small numbers of patients resulted in variable efficacy outcomes, with response reported as 0%, 75%, and 100%", ". Notably, amitriptyline and topiramate were found to be ineffective as monotherapy in patients subsequently found to have intracranial hypertension following mTBI, highlighting the importance of identifying headache phenotype or underlying headache syndrome when treating PTH. While several studies reported on the presence of migrainous headache prior to or following mTBI, none evaluated its impact on treatment outcomes.NeuromodulationOne retrospective study showed that transcranial direct current stimulation reduced headache frequency and severity in children with PTH. Over half reported headache resolution.33 This study benefited from clearly defined metrics of headache improvement but was limited by the lack of comparison group, small sample size, and inconsistent number of treatment sessions used.ProceduresOccipital nerve block Three retrospective case series reported PTH improvement following occipital nerve blocks", ". All were limited by small sample size, concomitant therapies, variable number of nerve blocks administered, and lack of comparator group. One study found that nerve blocks were effective at treating youth with acute or persistent PTH, many of whom reported migrainous headache and a personal and/or family history of migraine. In this cohort, 71% of occipital nerve blocks resulted in headache resolution immediately, and 93% of subjects reported a good therapeutic effect defined as >24 h pain reduction or repeat nerve block request.34 A smaller retrospective study also found benefit of greater occipital nerve blocks to treat adolescents with PTH; in this cohort, 6/15 patients had occipital neuralgia and 8/15 had occipital tenderness on exam. Nerve blocks were effective in reducing headache frequency with 9/15 participants reporting a \u226550% reduction,35 although time to follow-up was not clear", ". Finally, a case series described three patients with posttraumatic occipital neuralgia who reported complete but temporary benefit (days) of occipital nerve blocks.36Acupuncture One case series reported on three youth with PTH who reported a reduction in headache severity following multiple acupuncture sessions.37 The study is limited by the small case series design and concomitant use of other therapies for PTH in all three subjects.In summary, there is consistent evidence that occipital nerve blocks may be helpful for treating PTH in youth, but evidence is limited by small sample sizes and lack of comparator groups. Very limited data suggest acupuncture may also be helpful.Physical therapy and exerciseWe identified six studies (three prospective,38\u201340 three retrospective41\u201343) that evaluated PT and timing of increased activity on PTH in youth", ". Some reported headache improvement, whereas others found modest or no effect.Physical therapy A small prospective RCT of youth with postconcussion symptoms compared cervical spine and vestibular physical rehabilitation to standard of care. Both groups worked with a physiotherapist for 8 weeks or until medical clearance. Eleven of fifteen participants in the intervention group were medically cleared to return to sport versus 1/14 in the control group. None of the medically cleared patients reported persistent headache, although there was no significant difference in the reduction of headache symptom scores between those who were cleared or not cleared in either group.38 Conclusions for this study are limited by small sample size, and most comparisons that were made were between those who were cleared or not cleared for sports, not intervention versus standard of care", ". Retrospective analysis of a large prospective cohort provided fair evidence that a 4-week active rehabilitation intervention improved headache and postconcussion symptom scores for youth with persistent symptoms at 4 weeks post-injury.41 A small retrospective cohort study looking at the impact of PT, cardiovascular exercise, vestibular and oculomotor exercise, cervicothoracic manual therapy, and sports-specific training on postconcussion symptoms persisting beyond 3 weeks found a modest decrease in headache severity following intervention over 7 days to up to 6 months, though significance testing was not done. They did find a significant reduction in postconcussion symptoms overall (mean total symptom score pre-intervention 18.2 vs. post-intervention 9.1 p < 0.01).42Exercise A pilot, prospective RCT compared those who participated in a subsymptom threshold exercise program to a control group of youth who had sustained a concussion and were at least 4 weeks post-injury", ". Following intervention, both groups reported a higher percentage with mild or no headache. There was a significant effect in the intervention group when total postconcussion symptoms scores were evaluated, but significance testing comparing headache outcomes in the two groups was NR.39 A prospective study found that completing diagnostic exertional testing did not significantly reduce headache symptom scores 24 h after testing", ". This study was limited by a high drop-out rate (31%).40 One retrospective study looked at the impact of early physical activity (<3 weeks following mTBI) on the presence of PTH at the initial follow-up visit and found that those who did not report early physical activity were significantly more likely to report headache.43 Interpretation of this study is limited by the possibility that those who did not report early physical activity may have been experiencing more significant and more debilitating postconcussion symptoms at onset.In summary, there is poor to fair evidence to support physical and exercise therapy as a treatment for PTH, although not all studies reported a benefit", ". Notably, most studies were designed to look at postconcussion symptoms overall and not headache specifically.Collaborative care, cognitive behavioral therapy, and biofeedbackA large prospective RCT reported that collaborative care including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), care management, and medication consultation as needed significantly improved patient satisfaction and postconcussion symptoms compared to standard of care. However, there was no significant improvement in PTH,44 and details about medication used and for what purpose were not described.Another retrospective analysis evaluated biofeedback as a treatment for PTH in youth. Forty-six percent of the cohort reported an improvement in PTH, with 35% reporting reduced frequency and 23% reporting reduced severity", ". Participants who reported a decrease in headache severity or frequency following biofeedback were less likely to be on antidepressant medications and more likely to have stayed in school compared to those who did not respond.45 Sample size was NR and use of concomitant therapies limits interpretation.In summary, collaborative care including CBT was shown to improve overall quality of life and postconcussion symptoms but did not specifically improve headache outcomes.44 There is limited support for biofeedback improving PTH.Headache risk factors and characteristicsOf 27 studies, 7 reported headache with migrainous features,6,17,21,29,34,35,46 7 reported on premorbid migraine history,6,22,24,25,35,39,42 and 3 reported on migraine family history.6,24,34 When reported, the frequency of headache was high, with 61%\u201387% of patients described as having daily or constant headache.6,22,24,35,45 When considered as a confounding variable, presence of prior headache history appeared to impact", "When considered as a confounding variable, presence of prior headache history appeared to impact treatment outcomes,24,41 although this was not consistent across studies.25Four retrospective studies (all poor data quality) reported targeted treatments to headache phenotype", ". One study evaluating the efficacy of topiramate as a preventative specifically commented on reduction of \u201cmigrainous\u201d headaches.29 Two patients with stabbing headache were effectively treated with indomethacin.47 Case series that reported on posttraumatic occipital neuralgia36 and posttraumatic pseudotumor cerebri30,31 reported high response rates to targeted treatment.Timing of therapiesMost abortive pharmacologic therapies were studied between 48 h and 14 days after mTBI, and their efficacy was measured immediately to days after treatment. All other treatment modalities were studied in youth with at least 3\u20134 weeks of persistent symptoms. In some cases, symptoms were persistent for >1 year. The duration of preventative pharmacologic treatment, when reported, ranged from 5.5 weeks to 4 months on average.DISCUSSIONWe did not identify any studies that provided good quality evidence for treatment of PTH in children and adolescents", ". This finding is unchanged from systematic reviews of pharmacologic and procedural PTH treatment in adults and children,12,13 and from a review of postconcussive symptoms including headache.14 We expanded on this work by focusing specifically on headache in the pediatric population, including a broader range of treatments, and assessing for the presence of migrainous headache features and/or family and personal history of migraine in the reviewed studies. Limitations of the study design include that the searches were limited to identifying articles in English that were published in 1985 or later.Treatments that have been studied include abortive and preventative medications, procedures, neuromodulation, PT, exercise, collaborative care models, and behavioral therapies. There were two RCTs that supported the use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen17 and IV HTS23 in acute PTH", ". Overall evidence for preventative therapies was significantly limited by small sample sizes and lack of comparator groups. There was poor, but consistent evidence to support the use of occipital nerve blocks to treat acute and persistent PTH; however, sample sizes were small, and lacked appropriate comparator groups. The greatest number of prospective studies with comparator groups focused on nonpharmacologic strategies used to treat postconcussive symptoms including PT, exercise therapy, and collaborative care models. However, in most cases, headache was not the primary outcome, but rather one of multiple postconcussion symptoms being measured on an inventory. Further research is needed to assess the specific impact of these therapies on PTH.Defining headache characteristics following mTBIAlthough PTH is considered its own entity,3 there has been an effort to identify features of other primary and secondary headache disorders in PTH", ". A predisposition to migraine appears to act as a catalyst for PTH development,48 and some cases of PTH may be the abrupt onset of trauma-triggered migraine.11 A recent prospective multi-center cohort study demonstrated that those reporting migrainous headache <8 weeks post-mTBI were more likely to have a prolonged recovery, and were more likely to be prescribed preventative migraine medication.9 The authors proposed that migraine phenotype may represent a target for early intervention. We found that while many studies evaluated migraine-directed therapies, relatively few studies specifically reported on the presence of migrainous headache features and/or family or personal history of migraine. Studies that did target specific headache phenotypes reported high efficacy rates, although these were notably limited by small sample size and study design.The severity and frequency of PTH may also impact the efficacy of treatments. Chan et al", ". Chan et al. found that subjects who had a head CT in the ED were more likely to not respond to a combination of IV abortive therapies,25 with need for CT as a potential surrogate for symptom severity. While relatively few studies reported the presence of constant or daily PTH, this is a particularly critical group to focus efforts on due to high disease burden.Acute versus persistent PTHThere was variability in the definition of persistent symptoms and the timing of preventative therapy initiation with 1 and 3 months being the most common cutoffs", ". This likely stems from different definitions of \u201cpersistent\u201d in the mTBI literature, which range from 2 weeks up to 3 months.49 ICHD-3 criteria define persistent PTH as >3 months.3 Expert opinion has suggested that early treatment with preventative medications may be able to prevent the development of persistent PTH.50 However, there is no clear evidence-based determination of when it is most appropriate to switch focus from abortive to preventative pharmacologic therapies based on the results of this current review.Considerations for future clinical trial designWe propose the following recommendations based on our review: There is a need to establish standardized and validated metrics to measure headache improvement in PTH", ". Although guidelines to determine the efficacy of abortive therapies in children with migraine have not been established, in adults, the International Headache Society (IHS) recommendation for measuring pain resolution at 2 h as a primary endpoint and change in 4-point severity scale as a secondary endpoint51 would also be relevant for PTH. In children, the IHS recommends measuring the efficacy of preventative therapies as the change in total headache days/month.52 Measuring the number of severe headache days/month in addition may more effectively capture improvement for individuals with continuous headache. The PedMIDAS53 should be used as a metric of headache-related disability, which has been validated for time intervals as short as 1 month.54Consensus is needed on what constitutes persistent symptoms for research studies and when to start preventative therapies. We propose defining persistent symptoms as 4 weeks or longer", ". We propose defining persistent symptoms as 4 weeks or longer. Consensus is that symptoms persisting past the acute period (defined as 4 weeks for school-age children) usually do not have a single etiology, but rather involve a complex interplay between multiple biopsychosocial factors leading to a more complicated recovery.55 This definition diverges from the ICHD-3 criteria for persistent PTH3 but would encourage early headache intervention to prevent the development of prolonged symptoms.50Risk factors for prolonged recovery including family and personal history of migraine, and the presence of migrainous features with headache shortly after mTBI should be reported and taken into consideration in both research studies and clinical management of PTH.5,6,9Headache characteristics, including the presence of MOH, should be considered when choosing the most appropriate treatment", ". ICHD-3 criteria3 can be used to identify the characteristics and/or presence of other headache disorders following mTBI. Research is needed to understand whether mTBI can provoke other primary or secondary headache disorders and establish potential shared pathophysiologic mechanisms.CONCLUSIONThere is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the timing and types of therapies that are effective for treating PTH. Well-designed prospective studies with appropriate sample size and comparator groups that include thoughtful approaches to headache features, and timing of therapies are needed.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe would like to thank Maylene Qiu of the University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Library Systematic Review Service who provided us support in the design of the search strategy for this protocol.CONFLIC T OF INTERESTCPG: Dr", ".
