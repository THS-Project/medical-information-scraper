The immune context under which these are received can promote or prevent immune activating or inflammatory mechanisms and may orchestrate diverse immune responses in allergy and cancer. Each can act either by favouring a respective pathology or by supporting the immune response to confer protective effects, depending on acuity or chronicity. In this Position Paper under the collective term danger signals or DAMPs, PAMPs and AAMPs, we consider their diverse roles in allergy and cancer and the connection between these in AllergoOncology. We focus on their interactions with different immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune system and how these promote immune responses with juxtaposing clinical outcomes in allergy and cancer. While danger signals present potential targets to overcome inflammatory responses in allergy, these may be reconsidered in relation to a history of allergy, chronic inflammation and autoimmunity linked to the risk of developing cancer, and with regard to clinical responses to anti\u2010cancer immune and targeted therapies. Cross\u2010disciplinary insights in AllergoOncology derived from dissecting clinical phenotypes of common danger signal pathways may improve allergy and cancer clinical outcomes.Keywords: AAMP, allergy, ALR, cancer, DAMP, danger signals, immune response, immunotherapy, inflammation, NLR, PAMP, RLR, TLR, toleranceShort abstract AbbreviationsAAMPallergen\u2010associated molecular pattern moleculeDAMPdamage\u2010associated molecular pattern moleculePAMPpathogen\u2010associated molecular pattern molecule Highlights The immune context under which danger signals are received can promote or prevent immune activation or inflammatory mechanisms which are important determinants in the course of allergic diseases and cancer.Danger signals based on endogenous danger\u2010associated (DAMP), exogenous pathogen (PAMP) and allergen\u2010associated (AAMP) molecular pattern molecules, initiate immune responses, however, acuity, chronicity and immune context may influence the course of pathologies such as allergy and cancer.Allergens can introduce danger, and targeting AAMP\u2010induced signalling can be considered to overcome inflammatory responses in allergy and cancer.Immune cell\u2010derived mediators and danger signals involved in allergic disorders (hypersensitivity versus immune tolerance), also impact disease evolution in malignancies (pro\u2010tumour versus anti\u2010tumour activity), and the connected activities between these processes in both disease fields (AllergoOncology) require further study. 1. METHODSThis Position Paper is a product of the EAACI Working Group for AllergoOncology, an expert panel of clinical immunologists, allergists, biochemists and epidemiologists. The topic of the manuscript was identified at the WG workshop in May 2020, and a streamline of relevant subtopics was extensively revised and designated to individual WG members. After following workshops and using a circulation process, the manuscript was recirculated for review to the WG authors, compiled and again recirculated for complete consensus on text, tables and figures. The final manuscript was read and approved by all authors and represents an expert consensus position, with recommendations summarized in the \u2018Highlights box\u2019.2. DATA SOURCES, SEARCH STRATEGY AND STUDY SELECTIONStudies published in English were identified from PubMed. The following keywords were used in the search strategy: (allergy OR atopy) AND (tumor/tumour OR cancer OR malignancy) AND (danger signals OR damp OR pamp) AND (NK cells OR ILC OR mast cells OR granulocytes OR APC OR T cells OR B cells OR clinical applications)."

The immune context under which these are received can promote or prevent immune activating or inflammatory mechanisms and may orchestrate diverse immune responses in allergy and cancer. Each can act either by favouring a respective pathology or by supporting the immune response to confer protective effects, depending on acuity or chronicity",
    ". In this Position Paper under the collective term danger signals or DAMPs, PAMPs and AAMPs, we consider their diverse roles in allergy and cancer and the connection between these in AllergoOncology. We focus on their interactions with different immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune system and how these promote immune responses with juxtaposing clinical outcomes in allergy and cancer. While danger signals present potential targets to overcome inflammatory responses in allergy, these may be reconsidered in relation to a history of allergy, chronic inflammation and autoimmunity linked to the risk of developing cancer, and with regard to clinical responses to anti\u2010cancer immune and targeted therapies",
    ". Cross\u2010disciplinary insights in AllergoOncology derived from dissecting clinical phenotypes of common danger signal pathways may improve allergy and cancer clinical outcomes.Keywords: AAMP, allergy, ALR, cancer, DAMP, danger signals, immune response, immunotherapy, inflammation, NLR, PAMP, RLR, TLR, toleranceShort abstract AbbreviationsAAMPallergen\u2010associated molecular pattern moleculeDAMPdamage\u2010associated molecular pattern moleculePAMPpathogen\u2010associated molecular pattern molecule Highlights The immune context under which danger signals are received can promote or prevent immune activation or inflammatory mechanisms which are important determinants in the course of allergic diseases and cancer.Danger signals based on endogenous danger\u2010associated (DAMP), exogenous pathogen (PAMP) and allergen\u2010associated (AAMP) molecular pattern molecules, initiate immune responses, however, acuity, chronicity and immune context may influence the course of pathologies such as allergy and",
    "acuity, chronicity and immune context may influence the course of pathologies such as allergy and cancer.Allergens can introduce danger, and targeting AAMP\u2010induced signalling can be considered to overcome inflammatory responses in allergy and cancer.Immune cell\u2010derived mediators and danger signals involved in allergic disorders (hypersensitivity versus immune tolerance), also impact disease evolution in malignancies (pro\u2010tumour versus anti\u2010tumour activity), and the connected activities between these processes in both disease fields (AllergoOncology) require further study",
    ". 1. METHODSThis Position Paper is a product of the EAACI Working Group for AllergoOncology, an expert panel of clinical immunologists, allergists, biochemists and epidemiologists. The topic of the manuscript was identified at the WG workshop in May 2020, and a streamline of relevant subtopics was extensively revised and designated to individual WG members. After following workshops and using a circulation process, the manuscript was recirculated for review to the WG authors, compiled and again recirculated for complete consensus on text, tables and figures. The final manuscript was read and approved by all authors and represents an expert consensus position, with recommendations summarized in the \u2018Highlights box\u2019.2. DATA SOURCES, SEARCH STRATEGY AND STUDY SELECTIONStudies published in English were identified from PubMed",
    ". The following keywords were used in the search strategy: (allergy OR atopy) AND (tumor/tumour OR cancer OR malignancy) AND (danger signals OR damp OR pamp) AND (NK cells OR ILC OR mast cells OR granulocytes OR APC OR T cells OR B cells OR clinical applications)."
