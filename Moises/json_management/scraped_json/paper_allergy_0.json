The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of pirfenidone on transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-induced myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix accumulation. We also determined the molecular mechanisms of pirfenidone in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs).Methods: NPDFs were isolated from nasal polyps from eight patients who had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp. Pirfenidone was used to treat TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using a 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Fibroblast migration was evaluated with scratch assays. Expression levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), fibronectin, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were determined by western blot and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining. Total collagen production was analyzed with the Sircol collagen assay and contractile activity was measured by a collagen gel contraction assay.Results: Pirfenidone (0 \u2013 2 mg/ml) has no significant cytotoxic effects in TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs. Migration of NPDFs was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone treatment. The expression levels of \u03b1\u2013SMA and fibronectin were significantly reduced in pirfenidone-treated NPDFs. Collagen contraction and production were also significantly decreased by pirfenidone treatment. Finally, pirfenidone significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Smad2/3 pathway in TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs.Conclusions: Pirfenidone has an inhibitory effect on TGF-\u03b21-induced migration, myofibroblast differentiation (\u03b1-SMA), extracellular matrix accumulation, and collagen contraction by blocking the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 pathways in NPDFs. Thus, pirfenidone may inhibit TGF-\u03b21-induced extracellular matrix by regulating Smad2/3.A2 The efficacy of a 2-week course of oral steroid in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria refractory to antihistaminesHyun-Sun Yoon, Gyeong Yul ParkSeoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Correspondence: Hyun-Sun Yoon \u2013 Seoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Even though antihistamines are the mainstay in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), some CSU patients have not responded to antihistamines. Many clinicians have accepted the efficacy of steroids in the treatment of CSU. There is, however, little evidence supporting steroid use in antihistamine-resistant CSU. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of, and suggest a regimen for, oral steroid in the treatment of CSU patients who were refractory to a high dosage of antihistamines. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with urticaria between Feburary 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. A total of 98 patients with CSU were included. Of these, 16 patients (16.3%) were antihistamine-resistant and prescribed a 2-week course of steroid. Thirteen patients (81.2%) were successfully controlled with antihistamines only after stopping the first course. Second course of steroid induced remission additionally in two patients (12.5%). No adverse events and complications associated with oral steroid were observed over the study period. This study demonstrated the excellence of a 2-week course of oral corticosteroid in antihistamine-resistant CSU and propose standardized corticosteroid treatment regimen.A3 The altered distribution of follicular t helper cells may predict a more pronounced clinical course of primary sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndromeMargit ZeherDivision of Clinical Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary, Debrecen, Hungary Recent studies emphasized the important role of follicular T helper (TFH) cells, which contribute to B-cell differentiation, as well as antibody production. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible role of TFH cells in the pathogenesis of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (pSS). In the first part of the study, we focused on the periphery by analyzing immune-competent cells and serological markers. We enrolled 50 pSS patients and 16 healthy controls in the study. Patients had elevated ratio of peripheral TFH cells, however, when dividing patients into two groups defined by the presence of extraglandular manifestations (EGMs), only patients with EGMs differed from controls significantly. Moreover, TFH cell percentages correlated positively with both activated T cell and Tr1 cell values, but TFH cell percentages showed negative correlation with both IgM and IgG memory B cell proportions. Elevated TFH percentages were observed in the anti-SSA/SSB positive patients. In the second part, we concentrated on the site of the inflammation, and determined the composition of lymphocyte infiltration in labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies with special emphasis on TFH cells. We selected tissue blocks obtained from 10 patients at the time of disease onset. LSGs were graded based on the organizational level of periductal lymphocytic infiltrates. TFH cell markers occurred predominantly in more organized structures with higher focus scores. The co-expression of CD3 and Bcl-6 markers identified TFH cells close to Bcl-6+B cells with the typical formation of germinal centers. Systemic features were developed later in the disease course only in patients with more structured infiltrates.Our results indicate that the presence of TFH cells in LSGs at the disease onset may predict a more pronounced clinical course of pSS. We expect that the further understanding of the regulation of TFH cells will provide new potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of pSS patients with EGMs.A4 Betamethasone suppresses Th2 cell development induced by langerhans cell like dendritic cellsKatsuhiko Matsui, Saki Tamai, Reiko IkedaMeiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan Correspondence: Katsuhiko Matsui \u2013 Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan Objective: It is well known that Langerhans cells (LCs) work as the primary orchestrators in the polarization of immune responses towards T helper type 1 (Th1) or T helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses. In this study, we investigated the effects of tacrolimus and betamethasone on Th2 cell development by LCs.Methods: LC-like dendritic cells (LDCs) were generated from mouse bone marrow cells. Mice were primed with ovalbumin (OVA) peptide-pulsed LDCs, which had been treated with tacrolimus or betamethasone, via the hind footpad. After 5 days, the cytokine response in the draining popliteal lymph nodes was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of LDC surface molecules was investigated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Results: Administration of OVA peptide-pulsed LDCs, which had been treated with betamethasone, into the hind footpads of mice inhibited Th2 development as represented by down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-4 production as well as Th1 development as represented by down-regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production. However, unlike the LDCs treated with betamethasone, those treated with tacrolimus did not inhibit Th1/Th2 cell development. The inhibition of Th1 cell and Th2 cell development by betamethasone was associated with suppression of CD40 and TIM-4 expression, respectively, in LDCs.Conclusion: These results suggest that topical application of betamethasone to lesional skin would be beneficial for control of atopic dermatitis by acting on epidermal LCs and inhibiting the development of Th2 cells.A5 An evaluation of variousallergens in cases of allergic bronchial asthma at lucknow and neighbouring districts by intradermal skintestDrsushil Suri, Dranu SuriSuri Medical Foundation Hospital, Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh State, India Correspondence: Drsushil Suri \u2013 Suri Medical Foundation Hospital, Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh State, India The work of Kasliwas et al. (1959) and Shivpuri et al. (1971) have proved beyond doubt that there is a definite correlation between pollen peaks and symptomatology of the patients of respiratoty allergy. With these factors in mind the present study was conducted with the aims - to clinically evaluate the cases of bronchial asthma, to know the spectrum of allergens by skin testing in these cases(intradermal skin tests) and to find out seasonal and climatic variations in these cases.The patients were prepared for intradermal skin test as per Shivpuri et al (1964). The intradermal skin tests were performed by means of a tuberculin syringe and 26 gauge (1\u201dlength) short bevelled needle. A negative control test was done in the similar manner with 0.01ml of buffer saline (the diluent of the antigen) and marked as \u201cC\u2019. A positive control test was done by Histamine phosphate solution(100 microgram/ml) and marked as \u201cH\u201d.Interpretation was done as per Shivpuri\u2019s criteria (Shivpuri1962,1969). The 2 to 4 reactions were taken as \u201cmarkedly positive\u201d. This study showed that the prevalance of allergic manifestations were higher in first degree relatives (50%) than the second degree relatives (8%) of the patients. In this study the pollen antigens which gave \u201csignificant positive reactions\u201d (and there clinical correlation with the patient\u2019s history) in the descending order of significance were as Cassiasiamea, Adhantoda, Morus, Parthenium, Artemesia, Argemonemaxicana, Cannabisoccidentalis, Rumex, Asphodelous, Gynandropsis, Amaranthus, Cenchrusalbum, Ricinuscommunis, Crataeva nurvuala, Melia, Kigelia, Prosopsis, Pennisetum, Dodonaea, Azadirechta, Putranjiva rox-burghii. The extensive botanical and aero-biological surveys with clinical evaluation of a very largre number of cases of alleric bronchial asthma should be carried out in future in order to draw the exact polen calender of this region.A6 Evaluation ferqency of ADHD in childhood asthmaMarzieh Heidarzadeh AraniShahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran IntroductionAttention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder is one of the most common problems of children and adolescents and is a very common reason for visiting a pediatric psychologist or consultant. This disorder which has a profound effect on the lives of thousands of children and their families manifests in early childhood with symptoms of hyper activity, inattention and impulsivity. In studies conducted in western countries it has been pointed out that there is an association between ADHD symptoms and asthma in asthmatic children, and also the response to asthma treatment in children with ADHD is poor. This study is performed with the aim to evaluate the prevalence of ADHD in children referring to the clinic of Kashan Beheshti hospital.Material and MethodIn this case- control study 206 children referred to the pediatric clinic of Kashan Beheshti hospital in the second half of 1388 were evaluated. Spirometery or peak flow metery was used for the diagnosis of ADHD. Using the SPSS software version 19, chi- square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test.ResultIt was found that the prevalence of ADHD in children with asthma is significant higher than control group and increases the risk about five fold more. It was also found that having ADHD does not have a significant correlation with the severity of asthma.ConclusionIt was found that asthma is one of the risk factors for developing ADHD, but ADHD is not related to the severity of asthma morbidity.Keywords: Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, AsthmaA7 Steven johnson syndrome caused by typhoid fever in a childAzwin Lubis, Anang Endaryanto1Airlangga University Teaching Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia Correspondence: Azwin Lubis \u2013 Airlangga University Teaching Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia Background: Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) in children can caused by infection. Thypoid is one of bacterial etiologies.Case report: A 7 years-old boy with main complaint of blistering all over his body, fever and weak condition. His lips were ulcerated, erythematous, swollen covered with pseudomembran and hemorrhagic crust. There were pruritic hyperpigmented plaques with papilovesicular eruptions at their center (bullous target lesions) covered almost of his whole body. There were also macula erythematous with vesicle and ulceration in his external genital and scrotum. He suffered from blistering since 3 days before admission. The lesion appeared first in the face and mouth, then spreads to the whole body. After that his mucosa of mouth and lips were ulcerated and he had difficulty in swallowing. He had been on medical treatment to a doctor before, but on the 4th day of illness there were red blotches and vesicles appeared on his body, sore throat and oral thrush. So he admitted in hospital for 3 days, but his condition was getting worse and came to our hospital. The O widal test result was 1/320. The assessment were SJS and suspected Typhoid fever. Treatment were supportive, ceftriaxone and corticosteroid. This patient discharged in a good condition.Summary: Thypoid is one of SJS bacterial etiologies in children. Diagnosis established after clinical examination, serological, epidemiologically-prevalent and probable infections in country area. Antibiotic is required for SJS caused by infections.A8 Chronic Bronchitis with Radio Contrast Media Hypersensitivity: A Case with Hypothesized GINA Step 1 AsthmaShinichiro KogaTokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Background: Nonimmediate reactions induced by radio contrast media (RCM) are an important health problem because nearly 50 % of patients with a suspected nonimmediate reactions to RCM are confirmed as allergic (Gomez E, et al. Curr Opin Clin Immunol 2013;13: 345-53).Case Record: A 60-year-old female was brought to emergency department with chief complaint of hemoptysis one day after transient dry cough. Past medical history included current smoking in 30 pack-per-years, acute hypersensitivity reaction with nicotinic \u03b14\u03b22 receptor partial agonist valenicline, epilepsy on phenytoin and phenobarbiturate, and pollinosis. Body temperature 98.5 F, blood oxygen saturation 95 % in room air; No crackle, stridor, nor wheeze was audible. Contrast chest computed tomography show atelectasis in left lower lobe, but not about carvenous lesion, pulmonary arteriovenous fistula, nor racemose hemangioma. Bronchoscopy detected thrombus in left lower lobe; Mycobacterium avium, intracellulare, and tuberculosis were negative in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Specific immunofluorescence in M. tuberculosis was also in negative. Serum test was thoroughly negative in SCC, CYFRA, ProGRP, NSE, IgG4, PR3- and MPO-ANCA, Aspergillus, (1,3\u2192) \u03b2D-glucan, ANA, ds-DNA-IgG, anti-RNP, anti-sm, and anti-GBM antibodies. Clinical diagnosis of chronic bronchitis was made with findings described above. Pruritus exanthema in trunk one-and-a-half day after contrast media iomeprol infusion (Dona I, et al. J Investig Allergy Clin Imunol 2014;24: 143-53) was disappeared several days after bepotastine besilate administration.Discussions: Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA) step 1 was hypothesized because patients who were treated with GINA step 1 have reported to have over 3-fold-increased risk to develop acute hypersensitivity reaction as compared with patients who did not have asthma (Kobayashi D, et al. Chest 2012;141: 1367-8).Conclusions: Pharmacogenetics and/or transcriptomics should be helpful to clarify T-cell mediated mechanisms in development of RCM hypersensitivity reaction (Fernandez TD, et al. Allergy 2014;69: 150-8).A9 The association between asthma and depression in Korean adult : An analysis of the fifth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey (2010-2012)Lee Ju SukShinichiro Koga \u2013 Samsung Changwon Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Purpose: Asthma is a one of the most common allergic disease and depression is an important comorbidity in asthma. However, it is little known about the different prevalence of depression in Korean adult asthmatics than normal adults. This study was performed to find association between asthma and depression and investigate the characteristics in Korean adult asthmatics with depression.Methods: Data were acquired from 18,066 men and women, aged older than 19 years who participated in the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES), which was conducted from 2010 to 2012. The presence of asthma was based on self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma in the Health Interview Surveys.Results: The prevalence of asthma was 3.2 % and depression was 4.2 %. In univariated analysis, adults with asthma were older, single, unemployed, low educated, lower monthly family income, lower household members, obese (p<0.05) but sex, residence area and smoking status were not associated with the presence of asthma. The prevalence of hypertension and depression were higher in asthmatics (p<0.05), while diabetes mellitus was not associated with asthma. After adjustment for age, marital status, number of household members, monthly family income, body mass index, hypertension, we found unemployment, lower educated status, depression were associated with higher prevalence of asthma (p<0.01). Depression was associated with female, unemployment but not associated with lung function in asthmatics.Conclusion: The present study showed that depression was an important risk factor of the prevalence of asthma in Korean adult. These results warrant future studies to explore the mechanisms responsible for the association between depression and asthma.A10 Management of allergic disease exacerbations in pregnancyYasunobu TsuzukiSapporo Tokushukai Hospital, Japan Introduction: Allergic disease exacerbations can affect maternal and fetal conditions in pregnancy. Some of allergic disease exacerbations may trigger pregnancy complications, life-threatening events of the mother and fetus. Eventually, it predisposes both them to the risk of severe damages. We report 4 cases of maternal allergic disease exacerbations (food allergy(FA) and anaphylaxis, bronchial asthma(BA), atopic dermatitis(AD), allergic rhinitis(AR), atopic eruption of pregnancy(AEP)), their management is discussed.Case report: Case1: a 31-year-old female in 32 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of BA in childhood, AD, AR, FA, was referred by an otolaryngologist because of persistent moderate-to-severe asthma symptoms, severe AR. We introduced long-acting \u03b22-agonist plus inhaled corticosteroids, short term oral methylprednisolone and nasal corticosteroid. Case2: a 26-year-old female in 25 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of AD, but without a history of any FA or anaphylaxis, was brought to the emergency department because of dyspnea, generalized itchy rash, abdominal pain, and severe uterine contractions after having eaten dinner. She was diagnosed as anaphylaxis and threated abortion. She was immediately treated by epinephrine i.m injection 2 times and obsterician. We disclosed buckwheat allergy as the cause of anaphylaxis. Case3: a 30-year-old female in 27 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of AD, was referred by an obsterician because of her severe AD and AR. She had stopped the medication after her pregnancy, which developed severe AD and AR. We introduced local corticosteroids and nasal corticosteroid. Case4: a 34-year-old female in 31 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of AR and AD during her childhood, came to our hospital because of her severe itchy hives in her both arms and body. She was diagnosed as AEP and was introduced to use local corticosteroids. All mothers and their conditions improved immediately and the baibies of 4 cases were normally delivered without neurological deficiency or congenital malformations.Discussions: Allergic disease exacerbations may be common events during pregnancy, that reduce the maternal QOL and can even develop the potential risks of pregnancy complications, life-threatening events of mother and fetus, severe fetal brain damages. To prevent these situations, we should promote the appropriate therapies and educations to allergic diseases, and encourage the mothers to keep allergic medications, not only during pregnancy but prepregnant period. More investigations toward the pharmacologic management in allergic diseases are necessary to keep pregnant women and newborns healthy.A11 Subcutaneous immunotherapy mouse model for atopic dermatitisSeo Hyeong Kim1,2, Jung U. Shin1, Ji Yeon Noh1, Shan Jin1, Shan Jin2, Hemin Lee1, Jungsoo Lee1, Chang Ook Park1, Kwang Hoon Lee2, Kwang Hoon Lee11Department of Dermatology, Yonsei University College of Medicine; 2Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, South Korea Correspondence: Seo Hyeong Kim \u2013 Department of Dermatology, Yonsei University College of Medicine Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is a clinically effective treatment in atopic dermatitis. However, there was no mouse model to understand the mechanism of house dust mite immunotherapy in atopic dermatitis. The aim of this study was to establish a mouse model of SCIT mouse model of house dust mite induced atopic dermatitis. Female NC/Nga mice were treated with Dermatophagoides farinae (D.farinae) body extract ointment for 4 weeks to induce atopic dermatitis like skin lesion. Then we separated the mice into 2 groups, control group and immunotherapy (IT) group. Both groups were continuously treated with D.farinae body extract ointment for 4 weeks, however, only immunotherapy (IT) group was treated with 8 injections of D.farinae (100 ug subcutaneouse) twice a week along with D.farinae body extract ointment treatment. Subsequently, clinical severity of skin lesion, histological features, total IgE, IL-4 and IL-10 were measured. We observed that AD-like skin lesions of IT group were milder than control group. In histological examination, epidermis was thinner in IT group than control group. The level of total IgE was decreased in IT group than control group at 3 weeks from the beginning of immunotherapy, while the level of IgG4 was remarkably increased in IT group than control group from the beginning of immunotherapy. Increased level of IL-10 in IT group was observed at 2 weeks from the beginning of immunotherapy than control group. However, there was no significant difference of IL-4 between IT group and control group. In the present study, we have established a house dust mite SCIT mouse model and demonstrated that house dust mite SCIT might improve atopic dermatitis-like skin lesion by decreasing total IgE and increasing the IgG4 and Il-10. Using this model, it will be possible to find novel way to potentiate the effects of allergen immunotherapy.A12 Atopic disease and/or atopy are risk factors for local anesthetic allergy in patients with history of hypersensitivity reactions to drugs?Fatma Merve TepetamSureyyapasa Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training Hospital, Turkey Background: There is some concern among physicians that a positive history of adverse reactions to drugs and/or atopic disease remains a risk factor for developing a hypersensitivity reaction to local anesthetics (LA).Objective: In the present study we aimed allergy testing to LA is justified in patients with a positive history of hypersensitivity reactions to drugs additionally by atopy and atopic diseases.Methods: The study was conducted among patients admitted to our allergy clinic who gave a reliable history of urticaria/angioedema, nasoocular symptoms and bronchospasm after ingesting drugs. A standard questionnaire regarding demographic data, history of atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria) was filled out, total IgE and eosinophil count were assesed for each patient. Skin prick tests (SPT), intradermal test (IDT) and subcutaneus incremental challenge test (ICT) were perfomed step by step with adrenaline free lidokain and prilokain.Results: 239 patients (63men,176 women) with history of drug allergy were admitted. Asthma prevalence, atopy rate and mean total IgE levels are found higher in the study. When we look at the results of skin tests and provocations with LA; while positive results of SPT werent found, 3 of IDT and 4 of ICT were positive. Of the all 4 patients that reacted to LA, had rhinosinusitis and a positive SPT reaction with aeroallergens, 1 patient had also food allergy, 2 patient had asthma. Although eosinofil counts were normal, 2 patient had high level of total Ig E.Conclusion: There is no increased risk requiring performing skin and provocation test for LA in the patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to drugs alone but additionally by presence of atopy, atopic disease and multidrug allergy history can increase the risk of LA allergy, the amount of evidence is scarce.A13 Food hypersensitivity in patients with atopic dermatitis in KoreaChun Wook Park, Jee Hee Son, Soo Ick Cho, Yong Se Cho, Yun Sun Byun, Yoon Seok Yang, Bo Young Chung, Hye One Kim, Hee Jin ChoKangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea Correspondence: Chun Wook Park \u2013 Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea Background: It is well known that atopic dermatitis (AD) is related to food hypersensitivity, although its prevalence varies among several studies.Objective: To examine the prevalence and status of food hypersensitivity among AD patients in Korea.Methods: The history of food hypersensitivity was collected by interviews. We took blood samples to examine food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Based on patients\u2019 histories and serum IgE levels, open oral food challenge (OFC) testing were performed.Results: 49 (37.7%) of the 130 childhood AD patients and 33 (25.4%) of 130 adult AD patients had histories of food hypersensitivity. The most common suspicious foods in childhood AD were egg, pork and cow milk. In adult AD patients, the most common suspicious foods were instant food, wheat, ramen, beef, pork, chocolate. According to open OFC testing, nine childhood patients showed positive responses. The most common offending food were egg and milk (n=3 each), followed by pork, beef, peanut (n=1 each). In adult AD patients, only one patient showed positive response to pork.Conclusion: The overall prevalence of food hypersensitivity in childhood AD patients was 6.9%, and 0.8% in adult AD patients as assessed by open OFC testing. The number of patients with actual food hypersensitivity was lower than the number of patients reporting a history of food hypersensitivity. Therefore, dietary restriction must be conducted after confirming food hypersensitivity by medical professionals.A14 Anaphylaxis caused by an ant (Brachyponera chinensis) in JapanYoshinori Katada1, Toshio Tanaka2, Akihiko Nakabayashi1, Koji Nishida1, Kenichi Aoyagi1, Yuki Tsukamoto1, Kazushi Konma1, Motoo Matsuura1, Jung-Won Park3, Yoshinori Harada4, Kyoung Yong Jeong3, Akiko Yura4, Maiko Yoshimura41Sakai City Medical Center; 2Osaka University; 3Yonsei University College of Medicine; 4Osaka-Minami Medical Center Correspondence: Yoshinori Katada \u2013 Sakai City Medical Center, Japan A) Background: Index patientAnt allergy is rare comparing bee allergy. Anaphylaxis caused by Brachyponera chinensis is sporadically reported in Far East nations. We experienced such a case.An otherwise healthy 63-year-old woman who developed an anaphylactic reaction in a public open-air bath, some five minutes after an ant stung her hip. She fell down there and experiencing diarrhea, dyspnea and urticaria, and transferred to a hospital, where she recovered with catecholamines and antihistamines. Later, an ant named Brachyponera chinensis (Emery, 1895), which is often referred as Pachycondyla chinensis, was caught at the same place. Specific IgE against its venom protein was detected in her serum. This is the first case with specific IgE against ant venom proved in vitro in Japan.B) MethodsWe explored medline and a Japanese database seeking literature written English or Japanese for anaphylactic cases by ants in Japan and investigated its nature.C) ResultsIncluding present case, 9 cases (age 20~63, male 5, female 4) with anaphylaxis by ant siting have been reported in Japan since 1987. The numbers of ant stings just before the onset of anaphylaxis were 1 to 3. The intervals between ant stings and onset of anaphylaxis in most cases were less than 15 minutes, except 2 cases without description and 1 case, in which the onset was two hours after the ant sting. Symptoms include wheal and urticaria, diarrhea, dyspnea, and hypotension. As for diagnosis, the causal relationship between ant stings and anaphylaxis was established mainly based on their temporal order. The patients themselves or doctors in charge caught the ants on the same day or later, enabling determination of the ant species. In most cases, the ants were identified as B. chinensis. The proof of IgE antibody against ant protein was done by skin prick test only in 2 cases. Our present case is the first Japanese case in which IgE antibody against B. chinensis protein was directly proved. Epinephrine was used in 5 cases, while only anti-histamine and glucocorticoid were used in other cases with good prognosis. All patients had prior history of ant stings. Most of them had more than one ant sting before. The longest interval between the last prior sting and the trigger stings were 17 months. It is notable that 2 patients including our case had prior stings about a year before and a month before, suggesting that the second stings might have booster effects. Cross-reaction with bee venom was seen in 2 cases out of 5 cases mentioned. In one case, IgE antibody against paper wasp was positive without an obvious former sting by it. The other case had a history of anaphylaxis by a wasp sting.D) ConclusionsAnt allergy is rare. Its nature is similar to bee allergy.Lee EK, Jeong KY, Lyu DP, Lee YW, Sohn JH, Lim KJ, Hong CS, Park JW.Characterization of the major allergens of Pachycondyla chinensis in ant sting anaphylaxis patients. Clin Exp Allergy. 2009;39: 602-7.A15 Anti-allergic effect of anti-IL-33 by suppression of immunoglobulin light chain and inducible nitric oxide synthaseTae-Suk Kyung1, Young Hyo Kim1, Chang-Shin Park2, Tae Young Jang1, Min-Jeong Heo1, Ah-Yeoun Jung1, Seung-Chan Yang11Inha University, College of Medicine, South Korea; 2Inha University Hospital Correspondence: Tae-Suk Kyung \u2013 Inha University, College of Medicine, South Korea Objective: IL-33 is involved in several steps in allergic cascade. We aimed to find novel genes, which are significantly induced in allergic individuals and significantly down-regulated by anti-IL-33 treatment.Methods: Thirty-six mice were allocated into Group A (intraperitoneally sensitized and intranasally challenged to saline), Group B (sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin), Group C (null treatment with intraperitoneal saline) and Group D (anti-IL-33 intraperitoneal injection). We checked the number of nose-scratching behaviors in 10 minutes, serum ovalbumin-specific IgE, titers of cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Using one whole lung tissue from each mouse, we performed microarray analysis and real-time PCR.Results: Group D showed significantly reduced number of nose-scratching and lower serum ovalbumin-specific IgE. All cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly decreased after anti-IL-33 treatment. In microarray analysis, Group B (Immunoglobulin free light chain (IgFLC): 89.1 times, Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (NOS2): 11.5 times) and Group C (IgFLC: 141.6 times, NOS2: 11.7 times) had significantly increased expression of IgFLC and NOS2 gene compared to Group A. After anti-IL-33 treatment, Group D showed significantly decreased expression (IgFLC: 49.3 times, NOS2: 6.5 times). In real-time PCR, Group B (IgFLC: 10.4 times, NOS2: 3.8 times) and Group C (IgFLC: 29 times, NOS2: 4.5 times) had significantly increased expression of these genes. After treatment, Group D showed significantly decreased expression (IgFLC: 5.0 times, NOS2: 2.5 times).Conclusion: Anti-allergic effect of anti-IL-33 could be explained by suppression of IgFLC and NOS2 in a murine model of allergic rhinitis and asthma.Keywords: Asthma: Animal Models; ImmunoglobulinsA16 Food hypersensitivity in patients with chronic urticaria in KoreaHye One Kim1, Yong Se Cho1, Yun Sun Byun1, Yoon Seok Yang1, Bo Young Chung1, Jee Hee Son1, Chun Wook Park1, Hee Jin Cho21Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital; 2Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital Correspondence: Hye One Kim \u2013 Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea Background: The etiology of chronic urticaria (CU) remains unknown in most patients. Possible causes in some cases include food, but the role of hypersensitivity to food antigens in patients with CU remains controversial.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between food hypersensitivity and CU in 350 Korean participants.Methods: Patients with CU were assessed for a previous history of food hypersensitivity that caused symptoms of CU. Blood samples were taken from the patients to measure food allergen-specific IgE. Based on history and laboratory results, open oral food challenge (OFC) tests were performed.Results: Of 350 participants, 46 (13.1%) claimed to have experienced previous food hypersensitivity. Pork (n=16) were the main foods mentioned, followed by beef (n=7), shrimp (n=6) and mackerel (n=6). We found that 73 participants (20.8%) had elevated levels of food-specific IgE, with pork (n=30), wheat (n=25), and beef (n=23) being the most common. However, when the open OFC tests were conducted in 102 participants with self-reported food hypersensitivity or raised levels of food-specific IgE, only four participants showed a positive reaction to pork.Conclusions: Although some participants claimed to have a history of CU related to food intake, when an open OFC test was conducted, few of them had positive results. We therefore conclude that food allergy is an uncommon cause of chronic CU.A17 Dose optimizing study of a depigmented polymerized allergen extract of phleum pollen by means of conjunctival provocation test (CPT)Oliver Pfaar1, Angelika Sager21Center for Rhinology and Allergology Wiesbaden; 2Leti Pharma Gmbh, Germany Correspondence: Angelika Sager \u2013 Leti Pharma Gmbh, Germany Background: Clinical efficacy of a depigmented polymerized Phleum pollen extract has been shown in one large phase III studies with 1000 DPP/ml. To date dose-response studies are required to show optimal efficacy of an allergen dose. The conjunctival provocation test (CPT) is an outcome parameter accepted from the regulatory authorities (EMA).Method: 308 (ITT) patients with confirmed rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis were treated in a double-blind study with 4 doses of 100 DPP/ml, 1000 DPP/ml, 5000 DPP/ml and 10.000 DPP/ml allergen extract over 22 weeks in Germany, Poland, Spain and Czech Republic. A 1-day build-up phase applying 0.1 ml and 2 times 0.2 ml extract was followed by a maintenance period applying 0.5 ml in 3-4 weeks intervals. Before treatment a CPT was performed with increasing doses up to 3 HEP/ml of native Phleum extract, after treatment the CPT was repeated with doses up to 30 HEP/ml. The primary endpoint parameter was the percentage of patients with an increase of allergen extract to provoke a positive CPT after Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT). Secondary parameters were specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG4, Vitamin D baseline level as well as safety.The primary endpoint parameter was investigated using a hierarchic test procedure comparing the highest dose against the lowest, if statistically significant testing the next lower dose against the lowest until the difference was no longer significant.Results: The responder rates in the 100 DPP/mL and the 1,000 DPP/mL groups were 72.9% and 72.3%, respectively (ITT), in the 5,000 DPP/mL (75.3%) and the 10,000 DPP/mL groups (77.4%). The respective differences to the 100 DPP/mL group were -4.5% for the 10,000 DPP/mL group, -2.5% for the 5,000 DPP/mL group, and 0.6% for the 1,000 DPP/mL group (ITT). No statistically significant difference was found. For the PP set, similar results were observed. Vitamin D baseline results were low in all groups, but had no influence on the results. Specific IgEs remained stable in all groups whereas specific IgG1 and IgG4 showed dose-dependent increases. Systemic reactions occurred in 12.9% (100 DPP/ml), 10.8% (1000 DPP/ml), 26.4% (5000 DPP/ml) and 33.3% (10.000 DPP/ml) of patients. 79.4% of SR were Grade 1, 8.7% grade 2 and 1 grade 3 reaction occurred in the 100 DPP/ml group.Conclusion: We determined increased allergen amounts to obtain a positive CPT after AIT from 1000 -10.000 DPP/ml depigmented polymerized Phleum pollen extract. Since the CPT results did not discriminate the different doses the dose-finding study will be repeated with a different assessment method.A18 Correlation of cutaneous sensitivity and cytokine response in children with asthmaAmit Agarwal1, Meenu Singh1, Bishnupda Chatterjee2, Anil Chauhan11Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, India; 2West Bengal Technical University Correspondence: Amit Agarwal \u2013 Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, India Background: Food allergens play a pivotal role in the manifestation of atopic disorders like asthma, rhinitis, and eczema in children. Th17 cells play a key role in the regulation of inflammatory diseases, and there are few studies based on the role of Th17 in food allergic children.Methods: Fifty children with respiratory allergy and history of worsening symptoms by food allergy (Patient group) and 20 non-atopic healthy children (Control group) were enrolled in the study. Food allergy was assessed through Skin prick test (SPT) with various food allergens and total IgE levels was determined by sandwich ELISA. Th1, Th2, and Th17 dependent cytokines were determined by flow cytometric bead array.Results: In the study group, all the 50 children were found to be positive for cutaneous hypersensitivity against various food allergens (Milk and Orange=7, Egg=6, Banana, Fish and Groundnut=10, Mango=4, Wheat=9 and Rice=17). The average level of total IgE in the study group was 316.8\u00b1189.8 IU/mL. There was a significant positive correlation of total IgE with IL-17(r=0.796; p<0.0001), IL-13 (r= 0.383; p=0.01) and IL-4 (r=0.263; p=0.043) level, and negative correlation with IFN-\u03b3 (r= -0.5823; p<0.0001) and IL-10 (r= -0.4474; p<0.001) level. A negative correlation was noted between the duration of breast feeding and total IgE level (r=-0.31, p=0.03).Conclusions: The study demonstrates positive correlation between total IgE, Th2 cytokines and Th17 cytokines. It also demonstrated that duration of breast feeding is significantly correlated with Total IgE.A19 Colabomycin E, a Streptomycete-Derived Secondary Metabolite, Inhibits Proinflammatory Cytokines in Human Monocytes/MacrophagesIlja Striz1, Eva Cecrdlova1, Katerina Petrickova2, Libor Kolesar1, Alena Sekerkova1, Veronika Svachova1, Miroslav Petricek21Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Czech Republic; 2Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Correspondence: Ilja Striz \u2013 Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Czech Republic Polyketide antibiotics including macrolides are known to affect signalling pathways of transcription factors and regulate a number of genes involved in their potential anti-inflammatory effects but these properties cannot be used in clinical settings due to a risk of bacterial resistance. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of colabomycin E, a new streptomycete-derived secondary metabolite *, on the mRNA expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cell line and peripheral blood monocytes.Colabomycin E was isolated and purified from the natural producer Streptomyces aureus SOK1/5-04 by extraction of post-fermentation medias and mycelia with organic solvents and multiple subsequent liquid chromatography purification steps and crystallization. Monocytes/macrophages were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and then stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (20ng/ml) under serum free conditions in the presence or absence of colabomycin E. The total mRNA was extracted from cultured monocytes/macrophages with RNAeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantitative RT-PCR (SABiosciences) was used for the evaluation of 84 different gene expressions in TNF alpha and colabomycin E stimulated cultures and compared to unstimulated cells. The concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in culture supernatants of monocytes and THP-1 cells were measured by ELISA or Luminex.In THP-1 cells, Colabomycin E inhibited TNF alpha induced mRNA expression of several proinflammatory genes including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TLR8, and MyD88. The effect was evident after 4h and 8h cultures and in some of the genes persisted for 24h. Furthermore, colabomycin E downregulated TNF alpha induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and chemokine CXCL8/IL-8 release in a dose dependent manner from 0.25\u03bcM concentration. The secretion of IL-18 from THP-1 cells was only slightly upregulated by TNF alpha and not affected by colabomycin E. Our data suggest that colabomycin E is a potent transcription inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines in human mononuclear phagocytes.Supported by IGA MZCR grant NT/13012-4 and by MH CZ - DRO (\u201eInstitute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine \u2013 IKEM, IN 00023001\u201c).Reference*Petrickova K et al. ChemBioChem 15: 1334-45, 2014A20 Intravenous immunoglobluin treatment in a child with resistant atopic dermatitis: A brief review on this therapeutic regimenHyuck Hoon Kwon, Kyu Han KimSeoul National University Hospital, South Korea Correspondence: Hyuck Hoon Kwon \u2013 Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common dermatologic diseases, affecting approximately 20% of children living in industrialized countries. Moreover, approximately 70% of cases of AD affect children less than 5 years of age. Most cases of AD are effectively treated with topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors and intermittent use of immunosuppressive agents, including oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine. However, for recalcitrant AD, continuous use of systemic immunosuppressive agents is limited by severe adverse effects, especially for children. For this subgroup of patients, a few studies testing systemic immunomodulatory drugs have been reported, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy has been also intermittently reported to be effective without strong evidences. Herein we report a case of intractable atopic dermatitis in a 5-year-old girl who had a significant clinical improvement after receiving 3 cycles of IVIG treatment (2 g/kg) without notable side effects. Since the first infusion of IVIG, the patient\u2019s skin lesions improved steadily and the improvement persisted until the 8-month follow-up. The EASI score decreased remarkably, while the immunologic parameters did not correlate with clinical improvement. IVIG monotherapy is considered especially useful for children with severe AD since its immunoregulatory function is more profound in the relatively immature immune system of children. The mechanisms of action of immunoglobulin may include cytolysis of target cells through complement or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis of target cells, blockade of co-stimulatory molecules, and neutralization of pathogenic antibodies and soluble factors such as cytokines and their receptors, which ultimately lead to amelioration of the inflammatory process. This case suggests that IVIG therapy can be quite effective and safe for children with resistant atopic dermatitis.A21 Wheat allergy is difficult to diagnose then other food allergensSuman KumarEnt and Allergy Centre(INDIA), India BackgroundWheat allergy is common in children and adults.Skin prick tests and wheat specific IgE tests has low specific value for wheat then other allergens.The challenge tests are to be done to confirm Wheat allergy.It has been noticed that in patients of Wheat allergies the reactions may occur late .In normal food allergen challenges maximum number of reactions are found within one hour of food challenge and others in second hour. In wheat allergen challenge less number of reactions occur in first hour followed by some in second hours and rest occur after 2 hours of test.ObjectiveTo see wheather wheat challenge tests have delayed responses in patients of wheat allergy.MethodsDatabase of patients of Wheat allergy attending ENT AND ALLERGY CENTRE(INDIA)PANCHKULA. Retrospective study of wheat allergy patients for last 3 years.Observations68 patients of suspected wheat allergy were put on Wheat challenge tesrts.28 were positive, 2 were still not conclusive and 38 were negative.In wheat allergy challenge tests 25% patients showed reactions in 1st hour.55% patients reacted in 2nd hour and 20% reactions occurred after 2 hours.ConclusionIn wheat allergy patients we need to know that reactions can occur even after 2 hours of challenge in comparison with other reallergens in which most reactions occur in 1 st hour of challenge.A22 The effects of spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) dietary supplement as an adjunct therapy for children aged 7 to 14 years old with asthma: A randomized - double blind placebo controlled clinical trialLou Ver Leigh Arciaga Manzon1, Pilar Agnes Gonzalez Andaya21University of Santo Tomas Hospital, Philippines; 2University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine, Philippines Correspondence: Lou Ver Leigh Arciaga Manzon \u2013 University of Santo Tomas Hospital, Philippines A) Background: The anti-inflammatory effect of Spirulina has been demonstrated to inhibit histamine release from mast cell-mediated allergic reactions. Studies have documented the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of supplementation as an adjunct therapy for asthma.B) Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study wherein children 7 to 14 years old diagnosed with mild to moderate persistent asthma were randomly assigned to receive either Spirulina (1,000 mg to 2,000 mg daily) or placebo for three months. Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI) were used for patient report-based measures. Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were determined through spirometry. Post-supplementation assessment for three months was done.C) Results: A total of 39 patients (Spirulina = 20, placebo = 19) were enrolled in this trial. During the supplementation phase, both the Spirulina and placebo groups showed significant improvement in ACT scores (Spirulina, P < 0.0001; placebo, P = 0.19) compared to baseline. There was no significant change in CASI scores in both groups. However, during post-supplementation phase, the Spirulina group showed significantly sustained improvement on both the ACT (P < 0.0001) and CASI scores (P < 0.0001) compared to placebo. The FEV1 (P = 0.014), FVC (P = 0.008), and PEFR (P = 0.0001) of the Spirulina group significantly improved by the end of supplementation. Overall, significant intergroup differences revealed only in FEV1(P = 0.0002) and PEFR (P< 0.0001).D) Conclusion: Daily supplementation with Spirulina significantly improved asthma control, FEV1 and PEFR compared to placebo.A23 The study about cause and clinicopathological findings of injection induced dermatitisBark-Lynn Lew, Youngjun Oh, Dongwoo Suh, Woo-Young SimKyung Hee University Hospital at Gang-Dong, South Korea Correspondence: Bark-Lynn Lew \u2013 Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gang-Dong, South Korea Background: Cases of dermatitis by injection of certain drugs have been reported. This adverse reaction of drugs presents various features like eczematoid patch, and urticarial lesion, and so on.Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the cause and clinicopathologic findings of injection-induced dermatitis, and to reveal whether the reaction have any relations in the age, site, concentration of the drugs, and time interval from injection of drug to occurrence of skin lesion.Methods: This study enrolled 10 patients who had erythematous skin lesion after injection of causative drugs. The lesions are compared to each other based on the site, time interval from injection of drug to occurrence of skin lesion, and clinical characteristics. We perforemed intradermal test and patch test to each patient with different concentration of causative drugs.Results: The most common causative drugs were diclofenac and vitamin K1. Eczematous type was the most frequent clinical feature. Intradermal test showed more positive results than the patch test. Patch test with diclofenac (as is, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%) and vitamin K1 10% were all negative in 10 patients. And intradermal tests with diclofenac as is and vitamin K1 (0.1%, 1%, and 10%) were performed in 8 patients. Six patients had a positive reaction, consisting of erythema, induration and vesiculation after 1 and 2 days.Conclusions: In these results, most common causative agents were found as diclofenac and vitamin K1. And, it seems that intradermal test is more useful in the diagnosis of injection-induced dermatitis.A24 IgE reactivity of recombinant allergen pac c 3 of the Asian needle ant pachycondyla chinensisKyoung Yong Jeong1, Myung-Hee Yi1, Mina Son1, Dongpyo Lyu2, Jae-Hyun Lee1, Tai-Soon Yong1, Chein-Soo Hong3, Jung-Won Park11Yonsei University College of Medicine; 2Sangji University; 3Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine Correspondence: Kyoung Yong Jeong \u2013 Yonsei University College of Medicine, South Korea Background: Stings from the Asian needle ant are an important cause of anaphylaxis in East Asia. A 23-kDa protein homologous to antigen 5 is the major allergen produced by these ants. In this study, we aimed to produce a recombinant 23-kDa allergen.Methods: Recombinant 23-kDa allergen from the Asian needle ant was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Ni-affinity chromatography. IgE reactivity was demonstrated by ELISA and immunoblotting.Results: The recombinant protein was recognized in 5 of 6 serum samples (83.3%) from patients with demonstrated anaphylaxis to ants. IgE reactivity to a 23-kDa allergen from venom sac extract was specifically inhibited by the recombinant protein.Conclusion: A recombinant 23-kDa allergen from the Asian needle ant was successfully produced in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. This protein could be useful for the development of component-resolved diagnostics.A25 Characterization of specific IgE antibody related to antigen 5 of echinococcus granulosusMohammadreza SiavashiPasteur Institute of Iran, Iran Background: Anaphylactic reactions, such as urticaria,edema, respiratory symptoms and anaphylactic shock often complicate the course of cystic echinococcosis (CE).Methods: To investigate the role of the IgE immunoreactive antigen 5(Ag 5) in the sero-positive patients with CE, we determined N-terminal of 57 kDa subunit of Ag5 responsible for IgE and C-terminal of this active antigen related to induction of IgG specifically.Results: Immunoblotting analysis showed that specific IgE to 57 kDa subunit related to inter-chain disulphide band of two 22 kDa and 38 kDa components of Ag5 and conformational epitope on these subunits. In addition, since the 57kDa component arise from the removal of the C-termainal portion of 22kDa subunit of Ag 5, thus IgE specifically recognized N-terminal of 22 kDa subunit which remain bounded to the other component, whereas IgG reacted with C-terminal of 38 kDa component of Ag5.Conclusion: Recognition of the specific binding site on the 57kDa subunit of Ag5 can lead to understanding the regulating mechanism of IgE/IgG production in some immune circumstances that IgE tends to be dominated, whereas in other IgG is predominated.A26 Development of binary forecast model of asthma exacerbation: asthma indexHey Suk Yun1, Ha-Na Kang2, Jae-Won Oh3, Young Jin Choi11Hanyang University Medical Center; 2Hanyang University Seoul Hospital; 3Hanyang University Kuri Hospital Correspondence: Hey Suk Yun \u2013 Hanyang University Medical Center, South Korea Background: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, and a growing public health concern. It is characterized by chronic bronchial inflammation and a multi-factorial etiology that includes genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Our goal was to develop a patient-customizable asthma forecasting system that takes into account meteorological factors, air pollution, and pollen and viral respiratory infections, which are the most common environmental factors known to exacerbate asthma.Methods: We analyzed the health insurance records of patients who visited the emergency departments in Seoul due to an asthma attack and who were treated with salbutamol. Our potential predictors of asthma symptoms included meteorological factors (temperature, humidity, air pressure, and amount of sunshine), air pollution factors (ozone and Asian yellow dust), environmental factors (pollen) and health-related factors (seasonal influenza viral infection). Patients were assigned to five age groups and separated according to gender and season (5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 groups), which resulted in a total of 40 groups. Three models (a multiple regression model, a logistic regression model, and a decision tree) were tested for their ability to predict exacerbated asthma symptoms (referred to as \u201cattention\u201d symptoms). The suitability of the final model was assessed using predictability skill scores.Results: Logistic regression and the decision tree provided the best forecasts. Using the estimated binary values for \u201ccontinuous management\u201d versus \u201cattention\u201d symptoms, the optimal threshold was selected.Conclusions: Our binary forecasting model may improve the prediction of asthma exacerbation in a clinical setting.A27 Different levels in rantes, IL-5 and TNF-\u00e1 between the nasal polyps of adolescents with allergic, local allergic and non-allergic rhinitisJae-Won Oh1, Young Jin Choi1, Ha-Na Kang21Hanyang University Kuri Hospital; 2Hanyang University Seoul Hospital Correspondence: Ha-Na Kang \u2013 Hanyang University Seoul Hospital, South Korea Background: Nasal polyps are the result of chronic inflammation of the upper airways that develops in the ethmoidal and middle turbinate area. They are characterized by the presence of a number of inflammatory cells resulting from infiltration of eosinophils, Th2 cells, mast cells, and macrophages. Nasal mucosal immune-reactivity may occur in varying degrees accompanying polyps in allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. RANTES is locally produced within the nasal microenvironment of polyps and may be responsible for the eosinophil recruitment. Tumor necrosis factor\u2013alpha (TNF-\u03b1) along with Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-5 (IL-5) may stimulate nasal polyp fibroblasts to produce inflammatory mediators. We evaluated the differences in levels of RANTES, IL-5, and TNF-\u03b1 in nasal polyps from adolescents with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Our goal was to figure out the pathogenesis of allergic, local allergic and non-allergic rhinitis by evaluate different levels in RANTES, IL-5, and TNF-\u03b1 between the nasal polyps and serum from them.Methods: We recruited total 38 adolescents with allergic rhinitis (AR) (n=15, mean age: 17.4\u00b14.2 yrs old), local allergic rhinitis (LAR) (n=9, mean age: 15.9\u00b15.5 yrs old), and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) (n=14, mean age: 15.6\u00b12.9 yrs old) undergoing polypectomy. Atopic status was defined as presenting a sufficiently high total IgE serum concentration (IgE > 200 IU/mL) and a positive skin prick test or serum allergen test such as MAST (Green cross MS, Seoul, Korea) or ImmunoCAP system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Immunoassays were performed using polyp tissue homogenates and sera to quantify the levels of RANTES, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-5, and with sera to assess total IgE, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) produced by them.Results: RANTES levels were higher in LAR than in NAR, but there was no significant difference between AR and NAR. IL-5 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were higher in AR and LAR than in NAR but IFN-\u03b3 levels did not differ. There was significantly correlated between concentration of RANTES between polyp tissue homogenates and serum (R2 =0.51, P<0.05, n=38). IL-5, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 also demonstrated positive correlation between concentration of that between polyp tissue homogenates and serum, however, there were not significant.Conclusions: RANTES levels were higher in polyp tissue homogenates from LAR than in those from NAR. Therefore, RANTES probably involves in the pathogenesis of LAR. IL-5 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were higher in polyp tissue homogenates and sera from AR and LAR than in those from NAR. So IL-5 and TNF-\u03b1 probably play important role in the pathogenesis of AR and LAR.A28 Tgf\u03b21 level is associated with VDR gene polymorphism in children with allergy diseasesTatiana Sentsova1, Ilya Vorozhko1, Olga Chernyak1, Vera Revyakina1, Anna Timopheeva1, Andrey Donnikov21Institute of Nutrition; 2DNA-Technology, JSC Correspondence: Tatiana Sentsova \u2013 Institute of Nutrition, Russia Background: vitamin D receptor (VDR) is intracellulary located on the cells of the immune system and is involved in the immune response. The development of allergic inflammation is controlled by different genes, including the gene VDR.Aim: investigate TGF\u03b21 levels in children with food allergy and different variants of VDR gene polymorphism.Materials and methods: We examined 130 infants with allergic diseases aged from 1 to 12 months, who were on the artificial feeding. Measurement of TGF\u03b21 levels was performed by immunoenzyme method. RT-PCR with melting curve analysis was used for TaqI, BsmI and FokI VDR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detection. For statistical analysis Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc tests were used.Results: The frequency of allele A, homozygous A/A and heterozygous G/A genotypes in VDR gene site BsmI were significantly increased in children with allergic diseases compare population (OR = 1,81, p = 0.04; OR = 2,03, p = 0,05 and OR = 1,8, P = 0,05 respectively). Significantly decreased serum TGF\u03b21 levels in carriers of variants A/G and G/G comparably variant A/A carriers in FokI site (Me(q1;q3): A/A - 1134(897;1705) vs A/G \u2013 610(511;919) vs G/G \u2013 838(734;901) pg/mL, p=0.0216 ) were revealed. Statistically significant differences in serum TGF\u03b21 levels for TaqI and BsmI sites in VDR gene were not detected.Conclusion: FokI site VDR gene polymorphism may indirectly influence on TGF\u03b21 synthesis in allergy diseases development.A29 Dynamics of immunological biomarkers in children with food allergy fed goat milk formulaTatiana Sentsova, Ilya Vorozhko, Olga Chernyak, Vera Revyakina, Anna TimopheevaInstitute of Nutrition Correspondence: Tatiana Sentsova \u2013 Institute of Nutrition, Russia Background: Immunology evaluation of different diet therapy types in children with food allergy currently required. Goat milk formula are often used in diet therapy of children with food allergy.Aim: Investigate dynamics of immunological biomarkers in children with food allergy wich used goat milk formula supplementation.Materials and methods: We examined 66 infants with food allergy aged from 1 to 12 months, who were on the artificial feeding using goat milk formula. The dynamics of immunoregulatory substances IL-2,-4,-5,-10,-13, TGF-\u03b21 and allergen-specific IgE and IgG antibodies to cow milk protein, \u03b1-lactalbumin, \u03b2-lactglobulin, casein, soy and goat milk were measured by immunoenzime method. Observation duration was 28-30 days.Results: Dynamics of immunological biomarkers characterized decreased levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies to the cow milk protein and its fractions, reduced levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies to the cow milk protein and \u03b1-lactalbumin, and reduction of IL-4, -5, levels. These changes were correlated with clinical food allergy symptoms reduction.Conclusion: Assessment of of allergen-specific IgG antibodies to the cow milk protein and its fractions, allergen-specific IgE antibodies to the cow milk protein and \u03b1-lactalbumin, IL-4 and IL-5 can be used for immunology evaluation of the effectiveness goat milk formula supplementation.A30 Association between obesity, abdominal obesity and adiposity and the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in young Korean adults: The korea national health and nutrition examination survey, 2008\u20132010Ji Hyun Lee1, Young Min Park1, Sang Soo Choi1, Kyung Do Han2, Han Mi Jung1, Young Hoon Youn1, Jun Young Lee1, Yong Gyu Park2, Seung-Hwan Lee11Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, South Korea; 2College of Medicine, the Catholic University of Korea Correspondence: Ji Hyun Lee \u2013 Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, South Korea Background: Whether obesity is a risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between obesity and AD in Korean young adults.Methods: We included nationally representative data of 5,202 Korean adults aged 19\u201340 years, obtained from the cross-sectional Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008\u20132010.Results: AD prevalence exhibited a U-shape trend in relation to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and total body fat (BF) percentage, especially in young adult women. Women with BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2, WC \u2265 80 cm, and highest quartile (Q4) of total BF percentage had the highest prevalence of AD. The odds ratio (OR) for participants with both BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2 and WC \u2265 80 cm was 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71\u20133.55); therefore, having both general and abdominal obesity was considered prominent risk factors for AD in young women. After adjustment for confounding factors, including age, smoking, alcohol drinking, exercise, and vitamin D levels, high BMI (\u226530 kg/m2) (OR = 4.241, 95% CI: 1.60\u201311.24), high WC (\u226580 cm) (OR = 2.062, 95% CI: 1.08\u20133.94), and high BF percentage (Q4) (OR = 2.073, 95% CI: 1.22\u20133.52) were shown to be significantly associated with AD in young adult women.Conclusions: In this large-scale nation-wide study in Korean adults, obesity was positively related with the presence of AD in women. Our findings suggest that weight management might help to prevent AD.A31 Associations of natural history and environmental factors with asthma among children in rural and urban areas of Guangdong, ChinaJing Li1, Mulin Feng2, Marjut Roponen3, Bianca Schaub4, Gary WK Wong5, Zhaowei Yang61State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College; 2Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College; 3University of Eastern Finland; 4University Children\u2019s Hospital Munich; 5Prince of Wales Hospital; 6The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, China Correspondence: Zhaowei Yang \u2013 The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, China Background: Asthma is influenced by natural and environmental factors, but associations were still inconsistent.Objective: We aimed to explore associations between natural history and environmental factors and asthma in urban and rural children in China.Methods: A questionnaire survey was performed in 7164 children from urban Guangzhou and 6087 from rural Conghua. Subsamples of 854 children (419 from Guangzhou, 435 from Conghua) were recruited for case-control study including detail questionnaire for natural and family history, environmental exposure and eating behaviors, histamine airway provocation, allergen skin prick test, and serum antibody analysis. House dust samples from 76 Guangzhou and 80 Conghua families were obtained to analyze levels of endotoxin, house dust mite and cockroach allergens.Results: The prevalence of doctor-diagnosed-asthma was lower in children from Conghua (3.4%) than Guangzhou (6.9%, p<0.001) in the screening survey. A lower percentage for confirmed asthma (3.0% vs 28.9%) and sensitization (13.3% vs 50.6%) was found in rural than urban subjects (p<0.001) in the nested case-control study. Parental allergy (3.30 [2.08-5.24]), antibiotic usage (3.29 [1.93-5.60]), high frequency of milk consumption (2.31 [1.45-3.68]) and increased level of house dust Der f 1 (1.71 [1.34-2.19]) were positively associated with confirmed asthma (p<0.001). Breastfeeding (0.62 [0.39-0.97]), raising dogs (0.50 [0.26-0.94]) and level of house dust endotoxin (0.69 [0.50-0.95]) were negatively associated with confirmed asthma (p<0.05).Conclusions: Parental allergy, early antibiotic administration, high frequency of milk intake and level of Der f 1 exposure might be risk factors for asthma, while breastfeeding, dog ownership and endotoxin exposure were protective.A32 The effect of CO2-enriched atmospheres to producing of allergenic pollen by ragweedYoung Jin Choi1, Ha-Na Kang2, Jae-Won Oh31Hanyang University Medical Center, South Korea; 2Hanyang University Seoul Hospital; 3Hanyang University Kuri Hospital Correspondence: Young Jin Choi \u2013 Hanyang University Medical Center, South Korea Background: The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased result from exposure to environmental pollutants. Aeroallergen exposure is associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Pollens have long been known to be a significant cause of allergic disease. Pollen in heavily polluted zones can express a larger amount of proteins described as being allergenic. In the presence of high CO2 concentrations and temperatures, plants increase their pollen output.Method: Ragweed establishment: 1) Chamber study: Ten plants of ragweed were established in open-top chamber at different concentration of CO2 (380-400, 500-520, 600-620, 1000-1100ppm). 2) Field study: Beginning in March 2012 and 2014, a rural (Pocheon, Kyunggi-do, annual mean CO2: 230ppm) and urban (Kangnam, Seoul, annual mean CO2: 440ppm) locations were established. Seeds of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and giant ragweed (A. trifida) were obtained from Daejin University from a common seed lot of ragweed. At final harvest, entire plants were collected. To determine qualitative changes in pollen, harvested pollen grains were suspended in 95% ethanol. The crude soluble pollen protein preparations were stored at -20\u00b0. Protein content of the extracts was quantified. Concentration of Allergens (common ragweed (Amb a 1) and giant ragweed(Amb t 5) was quantified through use of double sandwich ELISA.Results: 1) chamber study: 1) chamber study: Concentration of Amb a 1 was increased with increased CO2 Conc. (380-400, 500-520, 600-620, 1000-1100ppm: 18.4\u00b15.0, 30.8\u00b113.1, 42.5\u00b111.2, 50.1\u00b121.2 ng/mL), Concentration of Amb t 5 was increased with increased CO2 Conc. (380-400, 500-520, 600-620, 1000-1100ppm: 22.1\u00b16.8, 36.3\u00b111.6, 48.3\u00b119.5, 64.6\u00b121.3 ng/mL), 2) Field study: There were not significantly different between Pocheon (CO2 230ppm: 16.0\u00b12.0ng/mL) and Seoul (CO2 440ppm: 20.3\u00b18.6ng/mL) in Conc. of Amb a 1, also Pocheon (CO2 230ppm: 24.5\u00b16.9ng/mL) and Seoul (CO2 440ppm: 28.3\u00b16.2ng/mL) in Conc. of Amb t 5, though Conc. of Amb a 1 and Amb t 5 were increased at Seoul than those at Pocheon.Conclusion: Increased CO2 significantly influence allergenicity and pollen concentration of common ragweed through the chamber and field study. The elementary example given here demonstrates strong probable links between rising CO2 levels and increased allergic diseases. We suggest that urbanization might provide a alternative to current experimental methods evaluating plant responses to climate change.Keywords: Allergens: Plant; Aeroallergens; Allergens: Environmental ControlA33 Application evaluation of house dust mite and components specific-IgE and IgG4 in specific immunotherapy with allergic diseasesBaoqing Sun, Peiyan ZhengFirst Affiliated Hospital Guangzhou Medical University Correspondence: Baoqing Sun \u2013 First Affiliated Hospital Guangzhou Medical University, China Objective: To observe the dynamic change of specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) to house dust mite including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) and its main components Der p1 and Der p2 after specific immunotherapy (SIT), and to evaluate the effect of its application in clinical monitoring of desensitization.Methods: This study observed the immune indexes of 51 children patients including the serum sIgE and sIgG4 to five periods of pre SIT(Pre)and after SIT (half of year (0.5Y),1 year,2 year(2Y) and 3 year(3Y)). 20 patients by conventional drug treatment were collected as control group.Results: After half of year of SIT, the levels of serum sIgE to Der p, Der p1 and Der p2 increased continuously, however, by then began to decline, after three years treatment, the levels of sIgE to Der p1 and Der p2 were reduced step by step, particularly, sIgE to Der p1 were significantly lower than Pre treatment. The levels of sIgG4 to Der p, Der p1 and Der p2 increased significantly along with the process of SIT. The increasing range of Der p sIgG4 reached to the maximum, followed by Der p1 and then Der p2. The sIgE/sIgG4 ratio of three allergens were decreased after SIT, and the biggest dropped degree was the sIgE/sIgG4 ratio to Der p1. The low age group of children (5 to 8 y) response to immune higher and faster than the high age group of children (9-16 y) after SIT, and the levels of components sIgG4 to Der p1 and Der p2 elevated faster than sIgG4 to Der p.Conclusions: In the early stage of treatment, the levels of Der p, Der p1 and Der p2 to sIgE and sIgG4 in serum by the body in a state of immune stimulating were significantly increased. As the SIT, the levels of sIgE gradually decreased, and the levels to sIgG4 increased, namely the sIgE/sIgG4 ratio reduced gradually, and the biggest declined of sIgE/ sIgG4 ratio was Der p1. the fastest degree to SIT reaction was the low age children with allergies.A34 Effect of Asian dust events on asthma according to the socioeconomic status using claim data in KOREAYoon-Sung ParkInha University Hospital, South Korea Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Asian dust events on asthma by socioeconomic status using claim data.Methods: Case crossover design was used. This study is based on the national health insurance claim (ICD : J45, J46), air pollutants [PM10(\u03bcg/m3), CO(ppb), SO2(ppb), NO2(ppb), O3(ppb)] and climate [temperature(\u00b0C), humidity(%), visibility(km), wind speed(m/s), air pressure(hPa)] data from 2007 to 2013 in Seoul and Incheon, Korea. The socioeconomic status was classified into health insurance group and medical aid group. The daily maximum value of air pollutants and daily average climate were calculated. The daily numbers of asthma cases on the \u2018Event\u2019 days were compared with \u2018Control\u2019 days. To select event days, 2 criteria were applied: 1) exclude weekends 2) excluded reoccurred Asian dust events on the 14 days before and after the Asian dust event. It was observed for 7 days after the events days. Control days is defined as the 7 days before and after the event days. Log poisson regression was used to estimate the ratio of averaged asthma cases using age, gender, region and climate between event and control days.Results: 7 event days were selected. On the event days, the average numbers of asthma cases were much more than the control days on the gender, age, region and socioeconomic status. However, there was no significant difference statistically. Humidity of the event days was lower (p=0.0950) but wind speed (p=0.0203) and PM10 (p=0.0376) were higher than control days. The estimated ratio of averaged asthma cases on event days was 0.96 (95% C.I.: 0.95-0.98). According to the socioeconomic status, the ratio of asthma patients during 7 days from \u2018day +0\u2019 to \u2018day +6\u2019 were as follows: 0.96 (0.95 - 0.97) on the day +0, 1.27 (1.26 - 1.29) on the day +1, 1.11 (1.09 - 1.13) on the day +2, 1.25 (1.23 - 1.26) on the day +3, 1.13 (1.12 - 1.15) on the day +4, 1.06 (1.04 - 1.07) on the day +5 and 0.83 (0.81 - 0.84) on the day +6 in the health insurance group. Also, in medical aids group, the estimated ratio of the each day were 1.00 (0.94 - 1.07), 1.14 (1.06 - 1.22), 1.15 (1.06 - 1.25), 1.18 (1.11 - 1.25), 1.08 (1.01 - 1.15), 1.02 (0.94 - 1.10) and 0.78 (0.74 - 0.83).Conclusion: Asian dust events can worsen asthma and its effects on asthma appear differently by the socioeconomic status. Time lag analysis is needed in studying asthma effect on Asian dust event using claim data.A35 TSLP downregulates human \u00e2-defensin 2 through STAT3-dependent pathway in keratinocytesSang Wook SonKorea University, South Korea TSLP downregulates human \u03b2-defensin 2 through STAT3-dependent pathway in keratinocytes.Department of Dermatology, Korea University College of Medicine.Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and pruritic inflammatory skin disease associated with a defective skin barrier and a dysregulation of Th2 immune response. Most patients with AD show reduced expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which may plays an important role in host defense against bacteria, fungi, and viruses infection. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has a pathogenetic role in the initiation and maintenance of allergic inflammatory diseases including AD. The function of TSLP was revealed in previous studies. However, it remains unknown that the regulatory mechanism of HBD-2 expression by TSLP in primary human keratinocytes.The present study demonstrates dose-dependent decreases of human \u03b2-defensin-2 (HBD-2) mRNA and protein levels in keratinocytes following stimulation to TSLP. In addition, this study demonstrated the effect of TSLP on HBD-2 expression in human skin equivalent models. We further investigated the regulatory mechanisms of TSLP-reduced HBD-2 expression in primary human keratinocytes. TSLP induced STAT-3 protein expression in primary human keratinocytes. Data from immunohistochemical stain for skin lesions of atopic patients demonstrated the increased expression of STAT-3 than normal skin. HBD-2 was regulated through STAT-3-dependent pathway in keratinocytes. Our results from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed the direct regulation of TSLP on HBD-2 promoter.Taken together, this study reveals that TSLP stimulation may reduce HBD-2 expression through a STAT\u20133 dependent mechanism in human keratinocytes. The present study suggests a novel and key role of STAT-3 in TSLP-mediated immune response in keratinocytes. Moreover, it would be helpful for understanding the pathologic signal transduction in AD.A36 Effects of anti-IgE on IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, and CD19,20,200 in a case of netherton syndrome (SPINK5 mutation)Sukran Kose1, Kemal Kiraz2, Arzu Didem Yalcin31Tepecik Training and Research Hospital; 2Antalya Education and Research Hospital; 3Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Turkey Correspondence: Arzu Didem Yalcin \u2013 Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Turkey Aim: Netherton syndrome (NS) is associated with the mutation in the SPINK5 gene, which codes LEKTI (lymphoepithelial Kazaltype related inhibitor), a serine protease inhibitor. LEKTI is expressed in epithelium, mucosa, and thymus. It is localized in the stratum granulosum of normal skin. NS is a rare genodermatosis characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, unknown etiology, ichthyosiform cutaneous changes, atopic diathesis, and alterations in the hair shaft. As a result of aging coupled with immune deficiency, clinical symptoms may vary.Materials and methods: A 20-year-old white Caucasian male presented to our Allergy-Immunology Unit with pruritus of the face and feet, skin desquamation, and sparse and thin hair. Dermatological examination demonstrated brittleness and scaling of the hairs, eyebrows, and eyelashes; erythema and desquamation of the cheeks; pinkish-red macules with scales; hypopigmented macular lesions on the ichthyosiform skin involving the area beginning from the patella and extending to the distal part of the leg; and lichenified, erythematous plaques with patchy fissures in both antecubital and popliteal regions. Microscopic examination of the material collected from the nails showed no fungal components. Subungual hyperkeratosis, discoloration, and destruction were noted in the toe nails. Patient presented to our clinic with sparse and brittle hair along with pruritic, erythematous, and scaling cutaneous lesions. Patient underwent a clinical examination and laboratory analyses. Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, patient diagnosed with Netherton syndrome.Results: Laboratory analyses yielded normal results except for a leukocyte count of 7,300/\u03bcL, CRP of 25.6 mg/mL (normal range: 0-5 mg/mL) and a total IgE of 31700 IU/mL (normal range: 0-100 IU/mL) and IgG of 20g/L(normal range: 7-16), IgA of 4g/L(normal range: 0.7-4), IgM of 0.9g/L(normal range: 0.4-2.3) and cow\u2019s milk,mite,grass, egg, hazelnut, orange, wheat, strawberry allergy were detected in the specific IgE studies. Anti nuclear antibody, hepatitis markers, HIV and rheumatoid factor were negative in patient. Renal function tests, complement-4 (C4), C3 levels were within normal ranges. During omalizumab treatment and after a short-term (4 months) treatment with omalizumab, he had a decreased CRP, IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, IL-1\u03b2 and CD19-20, CD200 and had an increased CXCL8 levels.Conclusion: NS, peeling skin syndrome type B, and skin dermatitis--multiple severe allergies--metabolic wasting syndrome are 3 autosomal recessive disorder resulting from aberrant regulation of epidermal desquamation. To our knowledge, this is the first time an association between omalizumab use and NS has been documented. As a conclusion allergic skin symptoms (pruritus, erythema, desquamation) and mucosal symptoms were decreased in patient.A37 Augmentation of arginase 1 expression exacerbates airway inflammation in murine asthma modelsSehyo Yune1, Jae-Won Paeng2, Mi-Jung Oh3, Byung-Jae Lee1, Dong-Chull Choi4, Young Hee Lim5, Kyoung Won Ha6, Jin-Young Lee71Samsung Medical Center; 2Samsung Biomedical Research Institute; 3Bundang Jaesang Hospital; 4Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine; 5Ansan Sarang General Hospital; 6Seoul Samsung Medical Clinic; 7Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical Center, South Korea Correspondence: Jin-Young Lee \u2013 Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical Center, South Korea Purpose: The expression of nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) and levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) are increased in allergic airway diseases. However, whether the upregulation of NOS has a deleterious effect on airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the pathophysiological role of NOS-2 in competition with arginase, using NOS-2 knockout mice in models of allergic asthma.Methods: We compared airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, as well as arginase expression, using NOS or arginase inhibitors in 6-week-old female C57BL/6, and NOS-2 knockout mice.Results: Airway hyperresponsiveness was unaffected by NOS-2 depeletion or NOS inhibition. However, airway inflammation was aggravated in NOS-2 knockout mice than in wild-type mice with augmentation of arginase I expression. Inhibition of arginase attenuated airway inflammation in wild-type and NOS-2 knockout mice.Conclusions: NOS-2 knockout mice showed increased ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation with augmentation of arginase I expression. Our results suggested that imbalance between NOS-2 and arginase with augmentation of arginase I expression resulted in aggravation of airway inflammation, and inhibitors of arginase I may be effective in suppressing allergic inflammation.A38 Caregivers of children with no food allergy \u2013 their experiences and perception of the conditionKiwako Yamamoto-Hanada, Masami Narita, Masaki Futamura, Yukihiro OhyaNational Center for Child Health and Development, Japan Correspondence: Kiwako Yamamoto-Hanada \u2013 National Center for Child Health and Development, Japan Background: Food allergy (FA) is one of the most important health issues in school children. Although one of the commonest places where pediatric anaphylaxis occurs is the home of a peer, the perception and experiences of caregivers who do not have a child with FA are unclear.Methods: Anonymous paper-based questionnaire were distributed to caregivers of FA children (FA caregivers) in National Center for Child Health and Development and caregivers of non-FA children (non-FA caregivers) in public school in Tokyo. We examined the perception and experiences of FA among three groups: Group1, non-FA caregiver who had not witnessed adverse reactions and near-miss events related to FA; Group 2, non-FA caregivers who had witnessed adverse reactions and near-miss events related to FA; and Group3, caregivers who had a child with FA.Results: Epinephrine auto-injector was recognized by 43.6% non-FA caregivers. Only 2.8% of non-FA caregivers had experienced a child being bullied, harassed or refused by a school because of FA. There were more caregivers in Group 2 who thought they could take the appropriate action if they witnessed a child with adverse response to causal food compared to Group 1 (p<0.05). All groups felt anxious over adverse events related to FA.Conclusion: The experiences and perception of FA was lacking low among non-FA caregivers. Therefore, it is also important to provide FA education for non-FA caregivers in order to improve the quality of life of FA children.A39 Evaluation of Drug Provocation Tests in Korean Children: A Single Center ExperienceJihyun Kim1, Jinwha Choi1, Kwanghoon Kim1, Jaehee Choi2, Kangmo Ahn11Samsung Medical Center, South Korea; 2Sahmyook Medical Center Correspondence: Jihyun Kim \u2013 Samsung Medical Center, South Korea Background: The aims of this study were to evaluate the common causative drugs of type B adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and to analyze the relationships between host factors and the results of drug provocation tests (DPTs) in Korean children.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all children younger than 19 years of age who underwent a DPT between November 1994 and November 2014. Open provocation tests were performed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, aminopenicillins, cephalosporin, non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, or other drugs.Results: Overall, 84 DPTs were performed in 56 patients whose median age was 7.5 years (range, 6 months to 18 years). DPTs were positive in 25 (29.8%) of 84 cases, which translated to 18 (32.1%) positive findings in 56 patients. Drugs that provided positive results included NSAIDs (7 cases, 28.0 %), aminopenicillins (5 cases, 20.0%), acetaminophen (4 cases, 16.0%), cephalosporins (3 cases, 12.0%), and non-\u03b2-lactams (2 cases, 8.0%). Anaphylaxis was noted in 5 (20.0%) of 25 cases. There were no serious complications of DPTs in any of the subjects. The median age was 10.5 years for children who had a positive result following the DPT and 5.0 years for those with negative results (Pvalue = 0.019).Conclusion: The overall positive DPT rate was 29.8%, with a lower rate noted in younger children. DPTs can be performed safely in children with suspected ADRs in order to achieve a correct diagnosis.A40 Danyoung classification 2015 update by digital HD endoscopic evaluationSun-Ho/Brian ChangKing Sejong ORL-Hns Clinic, South Korea PurposeAfter I first joined at 1996 AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting in Washington, DC as residency, I became interested in high resolution nasal endoscopy and I planned study design for allergic rhinitis patients. Research diagram of DANYOUNG classification consist of the study design, with the three periods at 20 years strategic plan. Using digital HD 3chip endoscopy, digital HD Flexible videoendoscopy and 3chip endoscopy, DANYOUNG classification 2015 update is achieved by better objective visual data files.MethodFrom Jun 2001 to Apr 2015, nasoendoscopic video data files were collected from allergic rhinitis patients. Nasoendoscopic video system is consist of stryker digital HD 3chip video camera system 1488 model, kay pentax digital HD Flexible videoendoscopy VNL-1190STK model and stryker 3chip video camera system 888, 988, 1088 model.

Stage 1 is hypertrophy state. Stage 2 is dimple state. Stage 3 is wrinkle state. A clear definition of stage is more characterized under digital HD endoscopic evaluation. Especially, irreversible change of nasal mucosa such as dimple and wrinkle shape is confirmed again.ConclusionDANYOUNG classification has very simple, objective advantage and useful on early diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. When OMU-CT is using together for allergic rhinitis patient, this staging is clear more than. DANYOUNG classification 2015 update can related on ARIA 2010 update, can be one in the future.Keywords: allergic rhinitis, stryker digital HD 3chip endoscopy, kay pentax digital HD Flexible videoendoscopy, Danyoung classification 2015 updateA41 Effect on quality of life of the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen extract immunotherapy in polysensitized patientsLisha LiPeking Union Medical College Hospital, China Background: Although many patients with allergic rhinitis have symptoms due to sensitization with more than one kind of allergens, and mixed allergen extracts are widely used for immunotherapy, there are few published trials.Methods: We performed a 1-year single-centre cohort study of subcutaneous immunotherapy using house dust mite extract, weed pollen extract, or mixed house dust mite/weed pollen extract in 44 allergic rhinitis patients. All the allergens responsible for the symptom of each patient were included in his immunotherapy. Quality of life was evaluated with the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) before and after 1-year immunotherapy.Results: After 1-year subcutaneous immunotherapy, RQLQ score of the house dust mite group 1.02\u00b10.82(n=12)was significantly better than baseline RQLQ score 2.25\u00b11.29 (p=0.024) ; RQLQ score for the weed pollen season of the weed pollen group 1.53\u00b11.13 (n=21)was significantly better than baseline level 3.08\u00b11.22 (p=0.000); RQLQ score for the weed pollen season of the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen group 1.78\u00b11.02 (n=11) was significantly better than baseline level 2.92\u00b11.25 (p=0.004), RQLQ for ordinary times of the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen group 0.62\u00b10.62 (n=11) was significantly better than baseline score 1.23\u00b10.84 (p=0.002). The reduction of RQLQ score in the house dust mite group was 1.23\u00b11.63, and 1.55\u00b11.24 in the weed pollen group after 1-year treatment. In the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen group, RQLQ for ordinary times deceased by 0.60\u00b10.47, with no difference compared to the house dust mite group (p=0.224); RQLQ for the weed pollen season decreased by 1.14\u00b11.01, with no difference compared to the weed pollen group (p=0.358).Conclusions: There was no significant difference between the effect on quality of life of the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen extract immunotherapy and the effect of the house dust mite extract or the weed pollen extract immunotherapy. The efficacy of multi-allergen immunotherapy was not weaker than that of single-allergen immunotherapy.A42 Ambient desert dust and allergic symptoms: A time series analysis from a national birth cohort (JECS)Yu-Ichi Adachi1, Kumiko Tsuji Kanatani21Toyama University School of Med; 2Kyoto University, Japan Correspondence: Kumiko Tsuji Kanatani \u2013 Kyoto University, Japan Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that desertification and climatic variability can contribute to increased desert dust formation in the air. Desert dust has been shown to exert adjuvant effects in animals.Objective: To examine if desert dust enhances allergic symptoms in real-life settings and to investigate its effect modifiers.Methods: We conducted a cohort study for 3,327 pregnant women during spring and fall in the period spanning October 2011 to May 2013 in three regions in Japan as an adjunct study of the Japan Environment & Children\u2019s Study. We timely acquired participants\u2019 daily symptom scores by sending a web-based questionnaire on high desert-dust days and on some randomly selected other days (control days) for each participant.Results: Pregnant women showed an increased risk of allergic symptom on protocol-defined high desert-dust days (OR 1.24, 95%CI 1.16 \u2013 1.32). The risk elevation was observed from a low level of desert dust in a dose-dependent manner even on control days. The risk-increase according to desert dust levels was observed when the air simultaneously contained pollen from Japanese cedar and cypress among subjects with positive serum IgE antibodies to Japanese cedar pollen, while no clear risk-increase was observed in the absence of pollen in the air.Conclusions: Ambient desert dust level was associated with increased risk of allergic symptom exacerbation in pollen-sensitized pregnant women when pollen was present in the air. The increase was dose-dependent, and was observed from a very low level. These results support a hypothesis that desert dust exerts adjuvant effects in human.A43 Individuals Allergic to Cow\u2019s Milk Should be Vigilant When Consuming Beef Because It May be Injected BeefShigeyuki Narabayashi1,2, Ikuo Okafuji2, Yuya Tanaka2, Satoru Tsuruta2, Nobue Takamatsu31Kakogawa City West Hospital, Japan; 2Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Japan; 3Beppu University Correspondence: Shigeyuki Narabayashi \u2013 Kakogawa City West Hospital, Japan Background: Natural \u201cmarbled\u201d beef is popular in Japan, but is expensive. \u201cAn injected beef\u201d, which is processed to improve texture of dairy cow\u2019s meat to give palate feeling of marbled beef by injection of fat, is sometimes served at relatively low price in restaurants. Such meat might contain milk protein (casein) as one of food additives.Methods: A 2-year-old boy with a history of adverse reactions to hens\u2019 eggs, cow\u2019s milk, and wheat from the age of 6 months had an anaphylactic reaction after eating beef steak at a hotel restaurant. This reaction occurred even though his parents asked the restaurant to ensure that the dish was free of hen\u2019s eggs, cow\u2019s milk, and wheat. We tried to discover the cause of this anaphylactic reaction. We asked the hotel restaurant by telephone about the ingredients of the dish they had served and to send some pieces of beef. We undertook a skin prick test with the meat that they sent. We determined the quantity of cow\u2019s milk protein in a piece of injected beef using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (FASTKIT\u2122; Nipponham, Tokyo, Japan).Results: The hotel restaurant did not use hens\u2019 eggs, cow\u2019s milk, or wheat, but they used injected beef that was labeled as containing casein, and they were not aware of this fact. The skin prick test was strongly positive for raw injected beef and heated beef. A piece of injected beef contained 1.193 mg/mL of cow\u2019s milk protein, which was sufficient to induce an allergic reaction.Conclusions: Even if injected beef is labeled appropriately, an allergic reaction can occur if chefs do not know that casein is a milk protein. Chefs need to be informed (in detail) about food allergies.A44 Quality of life of chronic rhinosinusitis patients with or without nasal polyps in KoreaSoo Whan Kim1, Do Hyun Kim21College of Medicine, the Catholic University of Korea, South Korea; 2The Catholic University of Korea Correspondence: Soo Whan Kim \u2013 College of Medicine, the Catholic University of Korea, South Korea Background: This is the first study of its kind to investigate the relationship between chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without nasal polyps (NP) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) within the Korean population.Objective: We sought to evaluate the association between CRS and HRQoL after adjustment for confounding factors in the general adult Korean population. We also evaluated HRQoL according to presence of NP in CRS patients.Methods: In this cross-sectional study we used nationally representative samples from the 5th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010\u20132012). A total of 17,490 participants were included in the study, of which 613 were diagnosed with CRS. Univariate analysis was conducted on healthy versus CRS groups, segregated by gender with weighted prevalence of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and comorbid diseases. Subanalysis was carried out to evaluate the relationship between CRS with or without NP and HRQoL using EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D). The odds ratios for EQ-5D were estimated by multiple logistic regression analyses with confounder adjustment.Results: Weighted prevalence of CRS of adult male participants was found to be 3.7% and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 0.5%, while female CRS was 3.3% and CRSwNP 0.3%. There was no significant difference between the groups (P =0.3321). The scores for female, EQ-5D index (P for trend <0.0001) and EQ-VAS (P for trend =0.0024) showed decreasing trend from healthy participants to CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and from CRSsNp to CRSwNP. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and comorbid diseases, EQ-5D scores; EQ-5D index (P <0.0001) and EQ-VAS (P <0.0001) exhibited poorer HRQoL compared to healthy participants, exclusively within the female group.Conclusion: These data suggest that female patients with CRS are at higher risk of poor HRQoL. In addition, HRQoL of female CRSwNP was lower compared to those of CRSsNP and healthy participants.A45 House dust mite sensitization and exacerbation of asthma in the fall in childrenJong-Seo Yoon, Jin Tack Kim, Hwan Soo Kim, Yoon Hong Chun, Hyun Hee Kim, Sul Mui WonThe Catholic University of Korea, South Korea Correspondence: Jong-Seo Yoon \u2013 The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea Background: Exposure and sensitization to house dust mite (HDM) allergens can trigger asthma exacerbation. The indoor concentration of HDM allergens and the prevalence of asthma exacerbation are higher in the fall than during the other seasons in South Korea.Methods: The study participants were children who visited the emergency room for acute asthma exacerbation. We measured their serum levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE), HDM-specific IgE (sIgE), cytokines, and chemokines.Results: Total IgE and HDM-sIgE levels were higher in the sera from children presenting with asthma exacerbation in the fall. We found no difference in the levels of cytokines and chemokines between the fall and the other seasons.Conclusion: Based on the fact that acute asthma exacerbation is most prevalent in the fall and that the indoor concentration of HDM allergens is the highest in fall, the higher levels of serum HDM-sIgE in children with asthma exacerbation presenting in the fall may suggest that HDM sensitization could be a risk factor for asthma exacerbation in the fall.A46 Evidence-based health advice for childhood eczema and household petsKam Lun E. Hon, Chung Mo Chow, Ting Fan LeungPrince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong Correspondence: Kam Lun E. Hon \u2013 Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong Background: Many parents seek healthcare advice if household pet keeping may be detrimental in atopic eczema (AE).Aim: We investigated if skin sensitization by cat/dog dander was associated with disease severity and quality of life in children with eczema.Methods: Demographics, skin prick test (SPT) results, disease severity (Nottingham eczema severity score NESS), Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), skin hydration (SH), transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of a cohort of AE patients were reviewed.Results: 325 AE patients followed at a pediatric dermatology clinic were evaluated. Personal history of asthma was lowest (20%) in the dog-dander-positive-group but highest (61%) in both-cat-and-dog-dander-positive group (p=0.007). Binomial logistic regression ascertained that cat-dander sensitization was associated with increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.056; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.006 to 1.109; p=0.029), dust-mite sensitization (aOR, 4.625; 95% CI, 1.444 to 14.815; p=0.010), food-allergen sensitization (aOR, 2.330; 95% CI, 1.259 to 4.310; p=0.007) and keeping-cat-ever (aOR, 7.325; 95% CI, 1.193 to 44.971; p=0.032); whereas dog-dander sensitization was associated with dust-mite sensitization (aOR, 9.091; 95% CI, 1.148 to 71.980; p=0.037), food-allergen sensitization (aOR, 3.568; 95% CI, 1.341 to 9.492; p=0.011) and keeping-dog-ever (aOR, 6.809; 95% CI, 2.179 to 21.281; p=0.001). However, neither cat nor dog sensitization were associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, parental or sibling atopic status, disease severity or quality of life.Conclusion: This study summarizes evidence for parental/patient guidance. There is no direct correlation between AE severity or quality of life with skin sensitization to cats or dogs. However, furry pets are a good source of house-dust mite and it had been shown in the study that AE patients are likely to be sensitive to them. Sensitized patients especially those with concomitant asthma and severe symptoms may consider non-furry alternatives if they plan to have a pet. Highly sensitized individuals, especially those with asthma co-morbidity, may have to remove their pet for a trial period to determine if symptoms improve.A47 Relationship between allergic rhinitis and mental health in KoreaDo Hyun Kim1, Soo Whan Kim21The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea; 2College of Medicine, the Catholic University of Korea Correspondence: Do Hyun Kim \u2013 The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea Background: There has been no nationwide population-based investigation of relationship between allergic rhinitis (AR) and mental health in Korea.Objective: To evaluate the association between AR and mental health status in the general adult Korean population. Also, to investigate relative burden of AR on mental health using Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) classification.Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by using data of 11,154 individuals 19 years old or older, collected through the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2012. Univariate analysis was conducted on Healthy, AR groups with weighted prevalence of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status and comobid diseases. Subanalysis classifying AR severity according to the ARIA classification was carried out to evaluate the relationship of AR severity with mental health. The odds ratios (ORs) for each components representing mental health status were estimated by multiple logistic regression analyses with confounder adjustment.Results: Univariate analysis with Chi-square test after adjusting age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use status and exercise status, components representing mental health status showed linear trend with the severity of AR according to ARIA classification. Stress, depressive mood, suicidal thought, psychological consultation factors were correlated with AR after adjusting demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status. Even after adjusting comorbid allergic diseases the correlation remained significant with stress, depressive mood, psychological consultation factors (OR [95% CI]; 1.227 [1.042, 1.445], 1.368 [1.095, 1.71], 1.804 [1.096, 2.969]).Conclusion: Patients with AR appear to be at a higher risk for mental health disorders in the general adult Korean population. Moreover, persistent or severe AR was correlated with poor mental health. Therefore, better control of AR may be conducive to better mental health and more attention should be paid to the psychological status of AR patients.A48 Oscillometric bronchodilator response in 3 to 5 years old healthy and asthmatic Filipino childrenGemmalyn Esguerra, Emily Resurreccion, Kristine Elisa Kionisala, Jenni Rose Dela CruzPhilippine Children\u2019s Medical Center, Philippines Correspondence: Gemmalyn Esguerra \u2013 Philippine Children\u2019s Medical Center, Philippines Background: Assessment of respiratory function is vital in the diagnosis and monitoring of children with asthma. Measurement of response to bronchodilator (salbutamol) is ideal for children 3-5 years old because it is not effort dependent, less invasive and requires less cooperation from the patient.Objectives: To compare the change in oscillometric parameters after inhalation of a beta 2- agonist among healthy and asthmatic children aged 3 to 5 years old using impulseoscillometry.Methods: The respiratory impedance at baseline and after 15 minutes of one dose of Salbutamol nebulization was measured with the impulse oscillometry(IOS) using the VIASYS (Healthcare ,Leibnizstr. Hoechberg Germany)at resistance at 5Hz and 20 HZ and reactance at 5HZ in 310 children aged 3-5years old. For the calculation of threshold or cutoff values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn and was determined by the Youden index (J = max{sensitivity + specificity \u2013 1}). Partial correlation study was done among multiple parameters to determine best positive correlation for diagnosis of asthma.Results: Fifty-six (18.1%) asthmatic subjects and 254 (81.9%) healthy subjects were able to complete the study. Mean percent (standard error of the mean) baseline pre bronchodilator indices for asthma were 1.21 \u00b1 0.02 kPa/L/s for Z5Hz; 1.15 \u00b1 0.02 kPa/L/s for R5Hz; 0.83 \u00b1 0.01 kPa/L/s for R20Hz and -0.37 \u00b1 0.01 kPa/L/s for X5Hz. In normal healthy subjects, the baseline mean values were 1.09 \u00b1 0.01 kPa/L/s for Z5Hz; 1.04 \u00b1 0.01 kPa/L/s for R5Hz; 0.79 \u00b1 0.01 kPa/L/s for R20 Hz and -0.31 \u00b1 0.01 kPa/L/s for X5Hz. In mean percent change initial values of asthmatics were -29.03% \u00b1 0.73 for Z5Hz; -28.77% \u00b1 0.81 for R5Hz; -22.96 % \u00b1 0.97 for R20 Hz and 36.91 % \u00b1 1.62 for X5Hz. Cut off values for bronchodilator response in diagnosing asthma using the percent change initial were as follows: -19.98% for Z5Hz with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%; -21.25% for R5Hz with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%; -13.96 % for R20 Hz with sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 78% and -24.25 % for X5Hz with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 88%. Percent initial change of Z5Hz and R5Hz (r = 0.938, p<0.001) are significantly correlated.Conclusion: Values at baseline and postbronchodilator on the different IOS parameters were significantly higher in the asthmatic group. A post-bronchodilator change of -20% in Z5Hz and -21% in R5Hz from the initial has strong positive correlation for the diagnosis of asthma. The computed percent change post-bronchodilator for Z5Hz and R5Hz are the best parameters that showed better accuracy in terms of specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of asthma using impulse oscillometry in our population.A49 The use of aeroallergen immunotherapy to treat eosinophilic esophagitisMuhammad ImranKansas University Medical Center, USA Introduction: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, eosinophilia of the esophagus, and may be associated with other atopic disorders. The pathogenesis of EoE is likely a mixed IgE and non-IgE food-mediated reaction with Th2 cytokines driving esophageal eosinophilia. Hence, therapy is aimed at inflammation control, with corticosteroids (oral or topical) and/or food antigen avoidance. However, these treatments are not specific, impair quality of life, and have significant side effects. Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to design alternative therapies.Background: To determine if EoE patients with concomitant seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis improve with aeroallergen immunotherapy (IT).Methods: We present a case series of 3 Caucasian patients with a history of atopy and EoE based on characteristic clinical symptoms, EGD findings, and esophageal biopsy. One had oral allergy syndrome. None of the patients had peripheral eosinophilia. Two had seasonal exacerbations of their EoE symptoms. These patients were all started on aeroallergen immunotherapy for atopic disease other than EoE.Results: In this small group of aeroallergen and food sensitized adult patients, we demonstrated a lack of improvement in clinical symptoms of EoE with aeroallergen immunotherapy while making no modifications in diet or oral medications. It is difficult to ascertain improvement due to the lack of a validated adult symptom score and inherent restraints of repeat esophageal endoscopy due to cost and procedural risks. It is also unclear if the biopsy always accurately reflects disease activity. There are several limitation of this small sample which includes absence of a control group, no statistical validity, and possible selection bias.Conclusions: We would like to continue further evaluation of the prevalence of aeroallergen sensitized adults with EoE and will consider a similar evaluation of pediatric patients. We will review further data at an attempt to isolate a population in which improvement with aeroallergen immunotherapy may be successful in improving control of EoE without aggressive dietary modifications or medication management.A50 A study of the eczema herpeticum in KoreanYun Seon Choe, Kyu Han Kim, Mira ChoiSeoul National University Hospital, South Korea Correspondence: Yun Seon Choe \u2013 Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea BackgroundEczema herpeticum (EH) is a widespread herpes simplex virus infection, most often presenting as complication of atopic dermatitis (AD). Along with increased incidence of AD, the number of patients of EH seems to be increased over the years. However, population-based epidemiologic data on EH are insufficient because of its rarity. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiologic trends of EH in Korean during last 10 years, comparing those with prevalence of AD.MethodsA retrospective analysis was carried out for patients diagnosed with EH between January 2005 and December 2014 at a single tertiary hospital in Korea. Variables of interest included age, sex, season of onset, treatment, outcomes, recurrence, and whether they had underlying AD or not. The prevalence of AD at the same period was investigated by the years.ResultsTotal 1,043 episodes of EH in 621 patients were diagnosed during ten years. The number of EH episodes per patient was 1.68 (range 1 - 6), with more than one episode in 288 patients. Mean age at onset was 23.4 years, and sex ratio was M: F = 1: 1.4. The patients who had recurrent episodes tend to be older (25.9 years) than those with EH episode only once (21.3 years), and there was no significant difference of sex ratio between two groups. Seasonal variation of onset was not found. Duration of treatment was 7.8 days, and most of treatment (93.7%) included systemic antiviral agent. Eleven patients were hospitalized and improved by intravenous antiviral agent, but six of them showed recurrence after discharge. Majority of patients with EH had underlying AD except only four patients. At the same period, total 33,692 patients were diagnosed as AD in our clinic, with continuous increase of prevalence annually. The ratio of EH/AD was 1.83% in average, and it was steadily decreased by years: 2.52% in 2005, 1.36% in 2014. EH was more commonly complicated in old age, showing significantly increased EH/AD ratio above 30 years old.ConclusionsEH is not a rare complication of AD, affecting about 2% of AD patients. While the prevalence of AD is increased over the years, total number of EH patients was little changed, leading to slight but continuous decline of EH/AD ratio. As patients getting older, EH could be more commonly complicated in AD, and show more recurrent course than in younger patients.A51 Specific sublingual immunotherapy in Korean patients with atopic dermatitisByung Soo Kim1, Hyun-Joo Lee1, Jeong-Min Kim1, Jeong-Min Kim2, Gun-Wook Kim1, Je-Ho Mun1, Je-Ho Mun2, Hoon-Soo Kim1, Margaret Song1, Hyun-Chang Ko1, Hyun-Chang Ko2, Moon-Bum Kim11Pusan National University, South Korea; 2Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital Correspondence: Byung Soo Kim \u2013 Pusan National University, South Korea Background: Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with house dust mites (HDM) preparation has recently been proven to be beneficial for treating allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, there has been no report regarding the efficacy and safety of SLIT in Korean patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of SLIT in Korean patients with AD.Methods: A total of 34 patients with AD and IgE-proven HDM sensitization (Class \u2265 3) were recruited from Pusan National University Hospital between July 2011 and September 2014. Patients were treated with SLIT for at least 12 months. Eczema area and severity index (EASI) score, total serum IgE level, results of specific IgE assays to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae, and adverse effects were recorded at each scheduled visit. \u201cResponder\u201d was defined as a patient with \u2265 30% improvement in EASI score after SLIT.Results: Twenty-three patients continued SLIT for 12 months or more, and 11 patients (32.4%) dropped out because of exacerbation of dermatitis or were lost to follow-up. The average duration of SLIT treatment was 22.4 months (range, 12\u201332 months). EASI scores reduced significantly after 12 months of treatment (p < 0.001) compared with those at baseline. A total of 19 patients (19/23; 82.6%) were determined to be responders to SLIT after 12 months. Total and specific IgE serum levels did not significantly reduce after SLIT. No patients experienced serious adverse events, with the exception of two patients who developed transient lip and tongue swelling.Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that SLIT with HDM extracts is effective and tolerable in Korean patients with AD. Further controlled long-term trials are required to reinforce the current results.A52 Association between polymorphisms in bitter taste receptors genes and clinical features in Korean asthmaticsSun-Young YoonAsan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, South Korea Background: Bitter taste receptors (TAS2R) in human airway smooth muscle have been recently shown to have an important role in bronchodilation, together with \u03b22-adrenergic receptors.Object: To evaluate the association between genetic variations in TAS2R and clinical features, including bronchodilator response and asthma control.Method: We analysed the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TAS2R10 and TAS2R14 and variables including demographic data, atopy, duration of disease, asthma control status, including variables such as asthma control test (ACT) score, percent predicted value of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio, and bronchodilator response (BDR), in 721 asthma patients in Korea.Result: Three novel SNPs of M207I, H203Q, and -79G/A in TAS2R10 and three known SNPs of -815C/T, -1267A/G, and -1897C/T in TAS2R14 were analysed. Increased BDR was significantly associated with SNP of -815T>C [OR (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 1.88 (1.01 \u2013 3.49), p=0.04], -1267 A>G [OR (95% CI) = 2.07 (1.03 \u2013 4.15), p=0.04] and -1897C>T [OR (95% CI) = 3.05 (1.01 \u2013 9.23), p=0.04, and OR=1.91 (1.08\u22123.36), p=0.02] of the TAS2R14 gene. There was a significant association between -815 T>C and low mean ACT score [OR (95% CI) = 5.84 (1.94 \u2013 17.61), p=0.001]. In haplotype analysis, TGT, CAT, and TGT, or TG and CA haplotypes on TAS2R14 were significantly associated with increased BDR; CAT and CA haplotypes were significantly associated with low ACT score.Conclusion: Genetic variations in TAS2R may be valuable genetic markers to predict therapeutic response and outcomes in asthma, although we had not sufficiently clarified the relationship between genetic polymorphism in TAS2R genes and the response to \u00df2-adrenoreceptor agonists. Further research in an independent cohort is needed.A53 Effect of glycosides based standardized fenugreek seed extract in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in ratsAmit KandhareBharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, India AbstractBackground: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive multifactorial disease with limited treatment options.Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of glycosides based standardized fenugreek seed extract (SFSE-G) on behavioral, biochemical, molecular and ultrastructural changes in bleomycin (BLM) induced pulmonary fibrosis in the laboratory rats.Materials and Method: IPF was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by single intratracheal BLM (6 IU/kg) injection followed by SFSE-G (5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) or Methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment for 28 day. Sham control rats received saline instead of BLM. The lung function test, biochemical, molecular, histopathological and ultrastructural changes were analyzed in lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after 14 and 28 days after the drug treatment.Results: Treatment with SFSE-G significantly restored the BLM induced alteration in body weight, lung index, lung function test and hematology. SFSE-G treatment significantly restored the altered total and differential cell count in BALF and blood. The BLM induced peripheral blood oxygen content reduction was significantly reversed by SFSE-G treatment. SFSE-G significantly enhanced the BALF and lung antioxidant status, through modulating the SOD, GSH, T-AOC, MDA, NO level and Nrf2, HO-1 mRNA expression. There was a significant reduction in lung 5-HT level by SFSE-G treatment. The altered mRNA expression of lung inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8), fibrotic markers (TGF-\u03b2, collagen-1, ET-1, Muc5ac, NF-kB, VEGF, Smad-3) and apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3) were significantly restored by SFSE-G treatment. BLM induced histological inflammatory, and fibrotic and ultrastructural changes of lungs were reversed by SFSE-G treatment.Conclusion: SFSE-G has potential efficacy against the fibrotic pathogenesis of BLM induced pulmonary fibrosis probably through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways."

    ". The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of pirfenidone on transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-induced myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix accumulation. We also determined the molecular mechanisms of pirfenidone in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs).Methods: NPDFs were isolated from nasal polyps from eight patients who had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp. Pirfenidone was used to treat TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using a 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Fibroblast migration was evaluated with scratch assays. Expression levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), fibronectin, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were determined by western blot and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining",
    ". Total collagen production was analyzed with the Sircol collagen assay and contractile activity was measured by a collagen gel contraction assay.Results: Pirfenidone (0 \u2013 2 mg/ml) has no significant cytotoxic effects in TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs. Migration of NPDFs was significantly inhibited by pirfenidone treatment. The expression levels of \u03b1\u2013SMA and fibronectin were significantly reduced in pirfenidone-treated NPDFs. Collagen contraction and production were also significantly decreased by pirfenidone treatment. Finally, pirfenidone significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Smad2/3 pathway in TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs.Conclusions: Pirfenidone has an inhibitory effect on TGF-\u03b21-induced migration, myofibroblast differentiation (\u03b1-SMA), extracellular matrix accumulation, and collagen contraction by blocking the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 pathways in NPDFs",
    ". Thus, pirfenidone may inhibit TGF-\u03b21-induced extracellular matrix by regulating Smad2/3.A2 The efficacy of a 2-week course of oral steroid in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria refractory to antihistaminesHyun-Sun Yoon, Gyeong Yul ParkSeoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Correspondence: Hyun-Sun Yoon \u2013 Seoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Even though antihistamines are the mainstay in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), some CSU patients have not responded to antihistamines. Many clinicians have accepted the efficacy of steroids in the treatment of CSU. There is, however, little evidence supporting steroid use in antihistamine-resistant CSU. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of, and suggest a regimen for, oral steroid in the treatment of CSU patients who were refractory to a high dosage of antihistamines",
    ". We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with urticaria between Feburary 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. A total of 98 patients with CSU were included. Of these, 16 patients (16.3%) were antihistamine-resistant and prescribed a 2-week course of steroid. Thirteen patients (81.2%) were successfully controlled with antihistamines only after stopping the first course. Second course of steroid induced remission additionally in two patients (12.5%). No adverse events and complications associated with oral steroid were observed over the study period",
    ". This study demonstrated the excellence of a 2-week course of oral corticosteroid in antihistamine-resistant CSU and propose standardized corticosteroid treatment regimen.A3 The altered distribution of follicular t helper cells may predict a more pronounced clinical course of primary sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndromeMargit ZeherDivision of Clinical Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary, Debrecen, Hungary Recent studies emphasized the important role of follicular T helper (TFH) cells, which contribute to B-cell differentiation, as well as antibody production. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible role of TFH cells in the pathogenesis of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (pSS). In the first part of the study, we focused on the periphery by analyzing immune-competent cells and serological markers. We enrolled 50 pSS patients and 16 healthy controls in the study",
    ". We enrolled 50 pSS patients and 16 healthy controls in the study. Patients had elevated ratio of peripheral TFH cells, however, when dividing patients into two groups defined by the presence of extraglandular manifestations (EGMs), only patients with EGMs differed from controls significantly. Moreover, TFH cell percentages correlated positively with both activated T cell and Tr1 cell values, but TFH cell percentages showed negative correlation with both IgM and IgG memory B cell proportions. Elevated TFH percentages were observed in the anti-SSA/SSB positive patients. In the second part, we concentrated on the site of the inflammation, and determined the composition of lymphocyte infiltration in labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies with special emphasis on TFH cells. We selected tissue blocks obtained from 10 patients at the time of disease onset. LSGs were graded based on the organizational level of periductal lymphocytic infiltrates",
    ". LSGs were graded based on the organizational level of periductal lymphocytic infiltrates. TFH cell markers occurred predominantly in more organized structures with higher focus scores. The co-expression of CD3 and Bcl-6 markers identified TFH cells close to Bcl-6+B cells with the typical formation of germinal centers. Systemic features were developed later in the disease course only in patients with more structured infiltrates.Our results indicate that the presence of TFH cells in LSGs at the disease onset may predict a more pronounced clinical course of pSS",
    ". We expect that the further understanding of the regulation of TFH cells will provide new potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of pSS patients with EGMs.A4 Betamethasone suppresses Th2 cell development induced by langerhans cell like dendritic cellsKatsuhiko Matsui, Saki Tamai, Reiko IkedaMeiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan Correspondence: Katsuhiko Matsui \u2013 Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan Objective: It is well known that Langerhans cells (LCs) work as the primary orchestrators in the polarization of immune responses towards T helper type 1 (Th1) or T helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses. In this study, we investigated the effects of tacrolimus and betamethasone on Th2 cell development by LCs.Methods: LC-like dendritic cells (LDCs) were generated from mouse bone marrow cells. Mice were primed with ovalbumin (OVA) peptide-pulsed LDCs, which had been treated with tacrolimus or betamethasone, via the hind footpad",
    ". After 5 days, the cytokine response in the draining popliteal lymph nodes was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of LDC surface molecules was investigated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Results: Administration of OVA peptide-pulsed LDCs, which had been treated with betamethasone, into the hind footpads of mice inhibited Th2 development as represented by down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-4 production as well as Th1 development as represented by down-regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production. However, unlike the LDCs treated with betamethasone, those treated with tacrolimus did not inhibit Th1/Th2 cell development",
    ". The inhibition of Th1 cell and Th2 cell development by betamethasone was associated with suppression of CD40 and TIM-4 expression, respectively, in LDCs.Conclusion: These results suggest that topical application of betamethasone to lesional skin would be beneficial for control of atopic dermatitis by acting on epidermal LCs and inhibiting the development of Th2 cells.A5 An evaluation of variousallergens in cases of allergic bronchial asthma at lucknow and neighbouring districts by intradermal skintestDrsushil Suri, Dranu SuriSuri Medical Foundation Hospital, Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh State, India Correspondence: Drsushil Suri \u2013 Suri Medical Foundation Hospital, Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh State, India The work of Kasliwas et al.

However, it is little known about the different prevalence of depression in Korean adult asthmatics than normal adults. This study was performed to find association between asthma and depression and investigate the characteristics in Korean adult asthmatics with depression.Methods: Data were acquired from 18,066 men and women, aged older than 19 years who participated in the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES), which was conducted from 2010 to 2012",
    ". The presence of asthma was based on self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma in the Health Interview Surveys.Results: The prevalence of asthma was 3.2 % and depression was 4.2 %. In univariated analysis, adults with asthma were older, single, unemployed, low educated, lower monthly family income, lower household members, obese (p<0.05) but sex, residence area and smoking status were not associated with the presence of asthma. The prevalence of hypertension and depression were higher in asthmatics (p<0.05), while diabetes mellitus was not associated with asthma. After adjustment for age, marital status, number of household members, monthly family income, body mass index, hypertension, we found unemployment, lower educated status, depression were associated with higher prevalence of asthma (p<0.01)",
    ". Depression was associated with female, unemployment but not associated with lung function in asthmatics.Conclusion: The present study showed that depression was an important risk factor of the prevalence of asthma in Korean adult. These results warrant future studies to explore the mechanisms responsible for the association between depression and asthma.A10 Management of allergic disease exacerbations in pregnancyYasunobu TsuzukiSapporo Tokushukai Hospital, Japan Introduction: Allergic disease exacerbations can affect maternal and fetal conditions in pregnancy. Some of allergic disease exacerbations may trigger pregnancy complications, life-threatening events of the mother and fetus. Eventually, it predisposes both them to the risk of severe damages",
    ". Eventually, it predisposes both them to the risk of severe damages. We report 4 cases of maternal allergic disease exacerbations (food allergy(FA) and anaphylaxis, bronchial asthma(BA), atopic dermatitis(AD), allergic rhinitis(AR), atopic eruption of pregnancy(AEP)), their management is discussed.Case report: Case1: a 31-year-old female in 32 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of BA in childhood, AD, AR, FA, was referred by an otolaryngologist because of persistent moderate-to-severe asthma symptoms, severe AR. We introduced long-acting \u03b22-agonist plus inhaled corticosteroids, short term oral methylprednisolone and nasal corticosteroid. Case2: a 26-year-old female in 25 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of AD, but without a history of any FA or anaphylaxis, was brought to the emergency department because of dyspnea, generalized itchy rash, abdominal pain, and severe uterine contractions after having eaten dinner. She was diagnosed as anaphylaxis and threated abortion",

We disclosed buckwheat allergy as the cause of anaphylaxis. Case3: a 30-year-old female in 27 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of AD, was referred by an obsterician because of her severe AD and AR. She had stopped the medication after her pregnancy, which developed severe AD and AR. We introduced local corticosteroids and nasal corticosteroid. Case4: a 34-year-old female in 31 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of AR and AD during her childhood, came to our hospital because of her severe itchy hives in her both arms and body. She was diagnosed as AEP and was introduced to use local corticosteroids",
    ". She was diagnosed as AEP and was introduced to use local corticosteroids. All mothers and their conditions improved immediately and the baibies of 4 cases were normally delivered without neurological deficiency or congenital malformations.Discussions: Allergic disease exacerbations may be common events during pregnancy, that reduce the maternal QOL and can even develop the potential risks of pregnancy complications, life-threatening events of mother and fetus, severe fetal brain damages. To prevent these situations, we should promote the appropriate therapies and educations to allergic diseases, and encourage the mothers to keep allergic medications, not only during pregnancy but prepregnant period. More investigations toward the pharmacologic management in allergic diseases are necessary to keep pregnant women and newborns healthy.A11 Subcutaneous immunotherapy mouse model for atopic dermatitisSeo Hyeong Kim1,2, Jung U",

    ". A standard questionnaire regarding demographic data, history of atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria) was filled out, total IgE and eosinophil count were assesed for each patient. Skin prick tests (SPT), intradermal test (IDT) and subcutaneus incremental challenge test (ICT) were perfomed step by step with adrenaline free lidokain and prilokain.Results: 239 patients (63men,176 women) with history of drug allergy were admitted. Asthma prevalence, atopy rate and mean total IgE levels are found higher in the study. When we look at the results of skin tests and provocations with LA; while positive results of SPT werent found, 3 of IDT and 4 of ICT were positive. Of the all 4 patients that reacted to LA, had rhinosinusitis and a positive SPT reaction with aeroallergens, 1 patient had also food allergy, 2 patient had asthma",
    ". Although eosinofil counts were normal, 2 patient had high level of total Ig E.Conclusion: There is no increased risk requiring performing skin and provocation test for LA in the patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to drugs alone but additionally by presence of atopy, atopic disease and multidrug allergy history can increase the risk of LA allergy, the amount of evidence is scarce.A13 Food hypersensitivity in patients with atopic dermatitis in KoreaChun Wook Park, Jee Hee Son, Soo Ick Cho, Yong Se Cho, Yun Sun Byun, Yoon Seok Yang, Bo Young Chung, Hye One Kim, Hee Jin ChoKangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea Correspondence: Chun Wook Park \u2013 Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea Background: It is well known that atopic dermatitis (AD) is related to food hypersensitivity, although its prevalence varies among several studies.Objective: To examine the prevalence and status of food hypersensitivity among AD patients in Korea.Methods: The history of food",
    "and status of food hypersensitivity among AD patients in Korea.Methods: The history of food hypersensitivity was collected by interviews",
    ". We took blood samples to examine food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Based on patients\u2019 histories and serum IgE levels, open oral food challenge (OFC) testing were performed.Results: 49 (37.7%) of the 130 childhood AD patients and 33 (25.4%) of 130 adult AD patients had histories of food hypersensitivity. The most common suspicious foods in childhood AD were egg, pork and cow milk. In adult AD patients, the most common suspicious foods were instant food, wheat, ramen, beef, pork, chocolate. According to open OFC testing, nine childhood patients showed positive responses. The most common offending food were egg and milk (n=3 each), followed by pork, beef, peanut (n=1 each). In adult AD patients, only one patient showed positive response to pork.Conclusion: The overall prevalence of food hypersensitivity in childhood AD patients was 6.9%, and 0.8% in adult AD patients as assessed by open OFC testing",

Anaphylaxis caused by Brachyponera chinensis is sporadically reported in Far East nations",
    ". Anaphylaxis caused by Brachyponera chinensis is sporadically reported in Far East nations. We experienced such a case.An otherwise healthy 63-year-old woman who developed an anaphylactic reaction in a public open-air bath, some five minutes after an ant stung her hip. She fell down there and experiencing diarrhea, dyspnea and urticaria, and transferred to a hospital, where she recovered with catecholamines and antihistamines. Later, an ant named Brachyponera chinensis (Emery, 1895), which is often referred as Pachycondyla chinensis, was caught at the same place. Specific IgE against its venom protein was detected in her serum",
    ". Specific IgE against its venom protein was detected in her serum. This is the first case with specific IgE against ant venom proved in vitro in Japan.B) MethodsWe explored medline and a Japanese database seeking literature written English or Japanese for anaphylactic cases by ants in Japan and investigated its nature.C) ResultsIncluding present case, 9 cases (age 20~63, male 5, female 4) with anaphylaxis by ant siting have been reported in Japan since 1987. The numbers of ant stings just before the onset of anaphylaxis were 1 to 3. The intervals between ant stings and onset of anaphylaxis in most cases were less than 15 minutes, except 2 cases without description and 1 case, in which the onset was two hours after the ant sting. Symptoms include wheal and urticaria, diarrhea, dyspnea, and hypotension. As for diagnosis, the causal relationship between ant stings and anaphylaxis was established mainly based on their temporal order",
    ". The patients themselves or doctors in charge caught the ants on the same day or later, enabling determination of the ant species. In most cases, the ants were identified as B. chinensis. The proof of IgE antibody against ant protein was done by skin prick test only in 2 cases. Our present case is the first Japanese case in which IgE antibody against B. chinensis protein was directly proved. Epinephrine was used in 5 cases, while only anti-histamine and glucocorticoid were used in other cases with good prognosis. All patients had prior history of ant stings. Most of them had more than one ant sting before. The longest interval between the last prior sting and the trigger stings were 17 months. It is notable that 2 patients including our case had prior stings about a year before and a month before, suggesting that the second stings might have booster effects. Cross-reaction with bee venom was seen in 2 cases out of 5 cases mentioned",

    ". We aimed to find novel genes, which are significantly induced in allergic individuals and significantly down-regulated by anti-IL-33 treatment.Methods: Thirty-six mice were allocated into Group A (intraperitoneally sensitized and intranasally challenged to saline), Group B (sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin), Group C (null treatment with intraperitoneal saline) and Group D (anti-IL-33 intraperitoneal injection). We checked the number of nose-scratching behaviors in 10 minutes, serum ovalbumin-specific IgE, titers of cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Using one whole lung tissue from each mouse, we performed microarray analysis and real-time PCR.Results: Group D showed significantly reduced number of nose-scratching and lower serum ovalbumin-specific IgE. All cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly decreased after anti-IL-33 treatment",
    ". In microarray analysis, Group B (Immunoglobulin free light chain (IgFLC): 89.1 times, Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (NOS2): 11.5 times) and Group C (IgFLC: 141.6 times, NOS2: 11.7 times) had significantly increased expression of IgFLC and NOS2 gene compared to Group A. After anti-IL-33 treatment, Group D showed significantly decreased expression (IgFLC: 49.3 times, NOS2: 6.5 times). In real-time PCR, Group B (IgFLC: 10.4 times, NOS2: 3.8 times) and Group C (IgFLC: 29 times, NOS2: 4.5 times) had significantly increased expression of these genes",
    ". After treatment, Group D showed significantly decreased expression (IgFLC: 5.0 times, NOS2: 2.5 times).Conclusion: Anti-allergic effect of anti-IL-33 could be explained by suppression of IgFLC and NOS2 in a murine model of allergic rhinitis and asthma.Keywords: Asthma: Animal Models; ImmunoglobulinsA16 Food hypersensitivity in patients with chronic urticaria in KoreaHye One Kim1, Yong Se Cho1, Yun Sun Byun1, Yoon Seok Yang1, Bo Young Chung1, Jee Hee Son1, Chun Wook Park1, Hee Jin Cho21Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital; 2Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital Correspondence: Hye One Kim \u2013 Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea Background: The etiology of chronic urticaria (CU) remains unknown in most patients",
    ". Possible causes in some cases include food, but the role of hypersensitivity to food antigens in patients with CU remains controversial.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between food hypersensitivity and CU in 350 Korean participants.Methods: Patients with CU were assessed for a previous history of food hypersensitivity that caused symptoms of CU. Blood samples were taken from the patients to measure food allergen-specific IgE. Based on history and laboratory results, open oral food challenge (OFC) tests were performed.Results: Of 350 participants, 46 (13.1%) claimed to have experienced previous food hypersensitivity. Pork (n=16) were the main foods mentioned, followed by beef (n=7), shrimp (n=6) and mackerel (n=6). We found that 73 participants (20.8%) had elevated levels of food-specific IgE, with pork (n=30), wheat (n=25), and beef (n=23) being the most common",
    ". However, when the open OFC tests were conducted in 102 participants with self-reported food hypersensitivity or raised levels of food-specific IgE, only four participants showed a positive reaction to pork.Conclusions: Although some participants claimed to have a history of CU related to food intake, when an open OFC test was conducted, few of them had positive results. We therefore conclude that food allergy is an uncommon cause of chronic CU.A17 Dose optimizing study of a depigmented polymerized allergen extract of phleum pollen by means of conjunctival provocation test (CPT)Oliver Pfaar1, Angelika Sager21Center for Rhinology and Allergology Wiesbaden; 2Leti Pharma Gmbh, Germany Correspondence: Angelika Sager \u2013 Leti Pharma Gmbh, Germany Background: Clinical efficacy of a depigmented polymerized Phleum pollen extract has been shown in one large phase III studies with 1000 DPP/ml.

Moreover, approximately 70% of cases of AD affect children less than 5 years of age",
    ". Moreover, approximately 70% of cases of AD affect children less than 5 years of age. Most cases of AD are effectively treated with topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors and intermittent use of immunosuppressive agents, including oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine. However, for recalcitrant AD, continuous use of systemic immunosuppressive agents is limited by severe adverse effects, especially for children. For this subgroup of patients, a few studies testing systemic immunomodulatory drugs have been reported, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy has been also intermittently reported to be effective without strong evidences. Herein we report a case of intractable atopic dermatitis in a 5-year-old girl who had a significant clinical improvement after receiving 3 cycles of IVIG treatment (2 g/kg) without notable side effects",
    ". Since the first infusion of IVIG, the patient\u2019s skin lesions improved steadily and the improvement persisted until the 8-month follow-up. The EASI score decreased remarkably, while the immunologic parameters did not correlate with clinical improvement. IVIG monotherapy is considered especially useful for children with severe AD since its immunoregulatory function is more profound in the relatively immature immune system of children. The mechanisms of action of immunoglobulin may include cytolysis of target cells through complement or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis of target cells, blockade of co-stimulatory molecules, and neutralization of pathogenic antibodies and soluble factors such as cytokines and their receptors, which ultimately lead to amelioration of the inflammatory process",
    ". This case suggests that IVIG therapy can be quite effective and safe for children with resistant atopic dermatitis.A21 Wheat allergy is difficult to diagnose then other food allergensSuman KumarEnt and Allergy Centre(INDIA), India BackgroundWheat allergy is common in children and adults.Skin prick tests and wheat specific IgE tests has low specific value for wheat then other allergens.The challenge tests are to be done to confirm Wheat allergy.It has been noticed that in patients of Wheat allergies the reactions may occur late .In normal food allergen challenges maximum number of reactions are found within one hour of food challenge and others in second hour",

Desert dust has been shown to exert adjuvant effects in animals.Objective: To examine if desert dust enhances allergic symptoms in real-life settings and to investigate its effect modifiers.Methods: We conducted a cohort study for 3,327 pregnant women during spring and fall in the period spanning October 2011 to May 2013 in three regions in Japan as an adjunct study of the Japan Environment & Children\u2019s Study",
    ". We timely acquired participants\u2019 daily symptom scores by sending a web-based questionnaire on high desert-dust days and on some randomly selected other days (control days) for each participant.Results: Pregnant women showed an increased risk of allergic symptom on protocol-defined high desert-dust days (OR 1.24, 95%CI 1.16 \u2013 1.32). The risk elevation was observed from a low level of desert dust in a dose-dependent manner even on control days. The risk-increase according to desert dust levels was observed when the air simultaneously contained pollen from Japanese cedar and cypress among subjects with positive serum IgE antibodies to Japanese cedar pollen, while no clear risk-increase was observed in the absence of pollen in the air.Conclusions: Ambient desert dust level was associated with increased risk of allergic symptom exacerbation in pollen-sensitized pregnant women when pollen was present in the air. The increase was dose-dependent, and was observed from a very low level",

    ". Such meat might contain milk protein (casein) as one of food additives.Methods: A 2-year-old boy with a history of adverse reactions to hens\u2019 eggs, cow\u2019s milk, and wheat from the age of 6 months had an anaphylactic reaction after eating beef steak at a hotel restaurant. This reaction occurred even though his parents asked the restaurant to ensure that the dish was free of hen\u2019s eggs, cow\u2019s milk, and wheat. We tried to discover the cause of this anaphylactic reaction. We asked the hotel restaurant by telephone about the ingredients of the dish they had served and to send some pieces of beef. We undertook a skin prick test with the meat that they sent. We determined the quantity of cow\u2019s milk protein in a piece of injected beef using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (FASTKIT\u2122; Nipponham, Tokyo, Japan).Results: The hotel restaurant did not use hens\u2019 eggs, cow\u2019s milk, or wheat, but they used injected beef that was labeled as containing casein, and they were not aware of this fact",
    ". The skin prick test was strongly positive for raw injected beef and heated beef. A piece of injected beef contained 1.193 mg/mL of cow\u2019s milk protein, which was sufficient to induce an allergic reaction.Conclusions: Even if injected beef is labeled appropriately, an allergic reaction can occur if chefs do not know that casein is a milk protein",

Chefs need to be informed (in detail) about food allergies.A44 Quality of life of chronic rhinosinusitis patients with or without nasal polyps in KoreaSoo Whan Kim1, Do Hyun Kim21College of Medicine, the Catholic University of Korea, South Korea; 2The Catholic University of Korea Correspondence: Soo Whan Kim \u2013 College of Medicine, the Catholic University of Korea, South Korea Background: This is the first study of its kind to investigate the relationship between chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without nasal polyps (NP) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) within the Korean population.Objective: We sought to evaluate the association between CRS and HRQoL after adjustment for confounding factors in the general adult Korean population. We also evaluated HRQoL according to presence of NP in CRS patients.Methods: In this cross-sectional study we used nationally representative samples from the 5th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010\u20132012)",
    ". A total of 17,490 participants were included in the study, of which 613 were diagnosed with CRS. Univariate analysis was conducted on healthy versus CRS groups, segregated by gender with weighted prevalence of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and comorbid diseases. Subanalysis was carried out to evaluate the relationship between CRS with or without NP and HRQoL using EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D). The odds ratios for EQ-5D were estimated by multiple logistic regression analyses with confounder adjustment.Results: Weighted prevalence of CRS of adult male participants was found to be 3.7% and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 0.5%, while female CRS was 3.3% and CRSwNP 0.3%. There was no significant difference between the groups (P =0.3321). The scores for female, EQ-5D index (P for trend <0.0001) and EQ-VAS (P for trend =0.0024) showed decreasing trend from healthy participants to CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and from CRSsNp to CRSwNP",

The pathogenesis of EoE is likely a mixed IgE and non-IgE food-mediated reaction with Th2 cytokines driving esophageal eosinophilia. Hence, therapy is aimed at inflammation control, with corticosteroids (oral or topical) and/or food antigen avoidance. However, these treatments are not specific, impair quality of life, and have significant side effects",
    ". Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to design alternative therapies.Background: To determine if EoE patients with concomitant seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis improve with aeroallergen immunotherapy (IT).Methods: We present a case series of 3 Caucasian patients with a history of atopy and EoE based on characteristic clinical symptoms, EGD findings, and esophageal biopsy. One had oral allergy syndrome. None of the patients had peripheral eosinophilia. Two had seasonal exacerbations of their EoE symptoms. These patients were all started on aeroallergen immunotherapy for atopic disease other than EoE.Results: In this small group of aeroallergen and food sensitized adult patients, we demonstrated a lack of improvement in clinical symptoms of EoE with aeroallergen immunotherapy while making no modifications in diet or oral medications",
    ". It is difficult to ascertain improvement due to the lack of a validated adult symptom score and inherent restraints of repeat esophageal endoscopy due to cost and procedural risks. It is also unclear if the biopsy always accurately reflects disease activity. There are several limitation of this small sample which includes absence of a control group, no statistical validity, and possible selection bias.Conclusions: We would like to continue further evaluation of the prevalence of aeroallergen sensitized adults with EoE and will consider a similar evaluation of pediatric patients",
    ". We will review further data at an attempt to isolate a population in which improvement with aeroallergen immunotherapy may be successful in improving control of EoE without aggressive dietary modifications or medication management.A50 A study of the eczema herpeticum in KoreanYun Seon Choe, Kyu Han Kim, Mira ChoiSeoul National University Hospital, South Korea Correspondence: Yun Seon Choe \u2013 Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea BackgroundEczema herpeticum (EH) is a widespread herpes simplex virus infection, most often presenting as complication of atopic dermatitis (AD).
