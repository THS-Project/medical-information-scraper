It is approved in the U.S.A. for patients aged \u2265 12 years with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe atopic dermatitis (AD) uncontrolled by topical prescription medicines or who cannot use topical medicines, for patients in Japan whose AD is uncontrolled with existing therapies, for patients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe AD in Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy and for patients aged \u2265 12 years for maintenance treatment of moderate\u2010to\u2010severe asthma uncontrolled with their current medicines. AD trials have reported increased incidence of conjunctivitis for dupilumab vs. placebo.ObjectivesTo characterize further the occurrence and risk factors of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials.MethodsWe evaluated randomized placebo\u2010controlled trials of dupilumab in AD (n = 2629), asthma (n = 2876), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) (n = 60) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) (n = 47).ResultsIn most AD trials, dupilumab\u2010treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than placebo controls. Higher baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence. Conjunctivitis was mostly mild to moderate. Most cases recovered or resolved during the treatment period; two patients permanently discontinued dupilumab due to conjunctivitis or keratitis. Common treatments included ophthalmic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Most cases were diagnosed by the investigators. In asthma and CRSwNP trials, the incidence of conjunctivitis was lower for both dupilumab and placebo than in AD trials; dupilumab did not increase the incidence compared with placebo. In the EoE trial, no patients had conjunctivitis.ConclusionsConjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab treatment in most AD trials. In dupilumab trials in other type 2 diseases, incidence of conjunctivitis was overall very low, and was similar for dupilumab and placebo. In AD, the incidence of conjunctivitis was associated with AD severity and prior history of conjunctivitis. The aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients require further study. What's already known about this topic? Ocular disorders, including allergic conjunctivitis, are common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).In most dupilumab AD trials, dupilumab\u2010treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than those receiving placebo.Most cases were mild to moderate and recovered or were recovering during study treatment; study treatment discontinuation due to conjunctivitis was rare.Conjunctivitis incidence was very low and similar for dupilumab and placebo in clinical trials in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic oesophagitis. What does this study add? This analysis confirms and extends the results of the individual clinical trials.Baseline disease\u2010related factors, including AD severity, prior conjunctivitis history and certain biomarkers (thymus and activation\u2010regulated chemokine, IgE, eosinophils), were associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis.Patients who responded well to dupilumab had reduced incidence of conjunctivitis.Further study is needed to elucidate the aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD.

This included 2629 patients in six AD trials: R668\u2010AD\u20101021 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT01859988\",\"term_id\": \"NCT01859988\"}}NCT01859988), LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02277743\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02277743\"}}NCT02277743), LIBERTY AD SOLO 2 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02277769\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02277769\"}}NCT02277769), LIBERTY AD CHRONOS ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02260986\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02260986\"}}NCT02260986), LIBERTY AD CAF\u00c9 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02755649\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02755649\"}}NCT02755649) and LIBERTY AD SOLO\u2010CONTINUE ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02395133\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02395133\"}}NCT02395133);23, 24, 25, 26, 36 2876 patients in three asthma trials: DRI12544 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT01854047\",\"term_id\": \"NCT01854047\"}}NCT01854047), LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02414854\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02414854\"}}NCT02414854) and LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02528214\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02528214\"}}NCT02528214);28, 29, 30, 31 60 patients in one CRSwNP trial: {\"type\": \"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"ACT12340\",\"term_id\": \"251754264\",\"term_text\": \"ACT12340\"}}ACT12340 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT01920893\",\"term_id\": \"NCT01920893\"}}NCT01920893)32 and 47 patients in one EoE trial: R668\u2010EE\u20101324 ({\"type\": \"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\": {\"text\": \"NCT02379052\",\"term_id\": \"NCT02379052\"}}NCT02379052) (Table S1; see Supporting Information).33 Details of the study methodologies were previously published.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36 Data were pooled for the three AD 16\u2010week monotherapy studies (monotherapy pool: R668\u2010AD\u20101021, SOLO 1 and SOLO 2).All trials were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for good clinical practice and applicable regulatory requirements.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36 End points and assessmentsClinical trial investigators (mostly dermatologists or allergists) diagnosed and reported conjunctivitis AEs, which were subsequently coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs). Unless otherwise specified, the term \u2018conjunctivitis\u2019 refers to the group of PTs that included the term \u2018conjunctivitis\u2019, namely conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis, adenoviral conjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. All cases of conjunctivitis were included regardless of aetiology (including blepharoconjunctivitis, which was coded as the MedDRA PT conjunctivitis; and excluding blepharitis in the absence of conjunctivitis).The study protocols did not require any specific query about ocular symptoms. AEs were generally reported by patients spontaneously, in response to the query \u2018did you have any problems?\u2019, or by investigators on physical examination during clinical visits. Investigators who reported conjunctivitis of unspecified aetiology were asked for more details, and whether they could use a more specific PT. In most cases, the aetiology remained unspecified or was designated \u2018allergic\u2019 by the investigator. Investigators differed in how they categorized conjunctivitis to type, as there were no prespecified classification guidelines. Most cases reported as infectious (e.g. viral or bacterial) did not have laboratory confirmation of infectious aetiology. Most cases were not referred to ophthalmologists or other eye specialists.The impact of baseline demographic and disease characteristics; baseline serum levels of thymus and activation\u2010regulated chemokine (TARC; CCL17), IgE and blood eosinophil counts; and efficacy responses on conjunctivitis incidence rates were summarized for the monotherapy pool, CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9. We evaluated the relationship between dupilumab concentration and conjunctivitis in pooled data from SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS.Statistical analytical methodsThese analyses evaluated all patients who received at least one dose of study drug by treatment and dose regimen received. Incidence rates described proportions of patients with at least one conjunctivitis event, without modelling or censoring for patient withdrawal or rescue medication use. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated based on a Cox regression model (with censoring after patients\u2019 withdrawal), to describe the relative risk for time to first conjunctivitis event, comparing the dupilumab and placebo groups. Treatment groups were fixed effects and the analysis was stratified by study and baseline disease severity [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) = 3 vs. 4 for AD\u20101021, SOLO, CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9; or IGA = 0 vs. 1 vs. 2 for SOLO\u2010CONTINUE]. Medians, percentiles and 95% CIs were obtained from Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates.Relationships of baseline characteristics and treatment response with conjunctivitis incidence were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Results from post hoc analyses showing annualized rate ratios by various factors were extracted from a duration\u2010adjusted Poisson model. Relationships between dupilumab concentration and conjunctivitis incidence were evaluated by dupilumab concentration (observed Ctrough, predicted Ctrough and AUCtau) in the placebo and dupilumab groups, based on pooled data from SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS, for weeks 0\u201316.ResultsAtopic dermatitis clinical trialsIncidence of conjunctivitis The incidence and HR of treatment\u2010emergent conjunctivitis were higher in dupilumab\u2010treated vs. placebo\u2010treated patients in the monotherapy pool, CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9. In the monotherapy pool, incidence rates (HR) for dupilumab vs. placebo after 16 weeks of treatment were 8\u00b76% vs. 2\u00b71% (HR 4\u00b713, 95% CI 2\u00b721\u20137\u00b772) (Table 1). A similar pattern was seen when adjusting for patient exposure [29\u00b798 vs. 7\u00b729 patients, respectively, per 100 patient\u2010years (PY)] (Table S2; see Supporting Information). In CHRONOS, incidence rates (HR) for dupilumab + topical corticosteroids (TCS) vs. placebo + TCS over the 52\u2010week treatment period were 17\u00b79% vs. 7\u00b79%, respectively (HR 2\u00b731, 95% CI 1\u00b747\u20133\u00b763) (Table 2). When adjusting for exposure, the rates were 21\u00b744 vs. 9\u00b724 patients per 100 PY, respectively (Table S2; see Supporting Information).

For the monotherapy pool and CAF\u00c9, new conjunctivitis events appeared at a relatively constant rate throughout the 16\u2010week studies (Fig. 2a,c). In CHRONOS, new cases appeared to level off around weeks 20\u201324 and were relatively uncommon after week 44 (Fig. 2b).

Symbols represent patients who discontinued study treatment.Baseline characteristics of patients with and without conjunctivitis Patients who reported conjunctivitis during the treatment period had more severe AD at baseline than patients who did not report conjunctivitis, regardless of assigned treatment group (dupilumab or placebo) (Fig. 3 and Table S3; see Supporting Information). In addition, prior history of conjunctivitis (Fig. 4 and Table S3), as well as higher baseline levels of the serum biomarkers TARC and IgE and higher baseline circulating eosinophil counts (all suggestive of higher disease severity), were associated with conjunctivitis in both dupilumab\u2010 and placebo\u2010treated patients (Figs S1 and S2 and Table S3).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Baseline characteristics and annualized events rate for patients\u2019 first events of conjunctivitis (event rate per 100 patient\u2010years; PY) for baseline Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) = 3 or 4.

Patients who achieved high\u2010level efficacy outcomes [IGA 0/1 or \u2265 75% improvement from baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75)] in the monotherapy pool were less likely to develop conjunctivitis than those who did not achieve those outcomes. In CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9, this pattern was apparent only in the dupilumab q2w and placebo groups (Figs S3 and S4; see Supporting Information).Dupilumab exposure and conjunctivitis Pooled data from baseline to week 16 in SOLO 1 and 2 and CHRONOS showed a trend suggesting that conjunctivitis incidence may decrease with higher trough concentrations of dupilumab (Table S4; see Supporting Information).Asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic oesophagitisIn all asthma trials, incidence rates of conjunctivitis were low, with no apparent differences between dupilumab\u2010 and placebo\u2010treated patients (Tables 9, \u200b,10,10, \u200b,11).11). In DRI12544, seven of 611 (1\u00b71%) dupilumab\u2010treated and two of 158 (1\u00b73%) placebo\u2010treated patients developed conjunctivitis.

By contrast, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trials of dupilumab in asthma, CRSwNP and EoE had low and similar incidence rates of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010 (0\u20131\u00b77%) and placebo\u2010treated (0\u20133\u00b73%) patients.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 In all trials, most cases of conjunctivitis were mild or moderate, and most resolved while continuing dupilumab treatment.Multiple factors (disease based and treatment based) are associated with incidence of conjunctivitis in these studies. Baseline AD severity and prior conjunctivitis history are most likely independent risk factors for conjunctivitis irrespectively of treatment, as incidence increases with baseline severity and prior history in placebo\u2010treated patients (as well as in dupilumab\u2010treated patients). CAF\u00c9, which had both the highest baseline level of AD severity and the highest rates of prior conjunctivitis history among all the AD trials, also had the highest rates of conjunctivitis. CAF\u00c9 was a later trial in this series, in which there might have been higher awareness of conjunctivitis as a potential AE. In contrast, conjunctivitis rates were lowest in SOLO\u2010CONTINUE, in which high\u2010level responders to dupilumab from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 were rerandomized to continued dupilumab treatment or placebo.Levels of certain biomarkers (TARC, IgE and eosinophils) increase with AD severity;22, 37, 38 thus, it is not surprising that both baseline AD severity and increased biomarker levels were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence in these studies. AD severity has been associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis,3, 8 and IgE levels are increased in patients with both AD and ocular complications.3, 4 High\u2010level efficacy responses (IGA 0/1, EASI 75) showed an apparent association with lower conjunctivitis incidence in dupilumab\u2010treated patients in the monotherapy pool; however, this trend was inconsistent or reversed in CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9. Fewer patients with severe AD at baseline achieved IGA 0/1 and EASI 75. Increased disease severity is associated with higher incidence of comorbidities and higher AD biomarkers, so these predictors may be interrelated.The pharmacokinetic data suggested, somewhat paradoxically, that lower dupilumab exposure might be associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis compared with higher dupilumab exposure. This finding would not be expected if there was a positive dose\u2013response relationship between dupilumab exposure and occurrence of conjunctivitis. Furthermore, 80% of cases resolved while continuing on dupilumab treatment. Thus, further study is warranted to understand better the underlying cause of the imbalance in events between treatment groups.Currently, there is no consensus on optimal approaches to prevent and manage conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients. Ophthalmic preparations of corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers were the most common treatments used for conjunctivitis in these trials. Case series and case reports have described several therapeutic approaches used successfully in clinical practice for treatment of conjunctivitis associated with dupilumab without discontinuation of dupilumab, including hyaluronic acid eyedrops, topical tacrolimus, TCS (e.g. fluorometholone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone), artificial tears, compounded oily ciclosporin eyedrops and antibiotic\u2013TCS combination therapies.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 As long\u2010term treatment with ophthalmic TCS can lead to more serious eye disorders such as cataracts and glaucoma, products with poor penetration into the anterior chamber of the eye (e.g. fluorometholone) should be considered. In addition, topical preparations of calcineurin inhibitors appear to be a reasonable long\u2010term therapeutic alternative.39 Patients who develop ocular symptoms during dupilumab treatment should receive full ophthalmic evaluations, and addition of an ophthalmologist to the patient management team may be of benefit.4, 39, 46 An important aspect of these analyses is that, based on existing data, and in the absence of ophthalmological or microbiological evaluation, it was not possible to identify events that were specific or pathognomonic for dupilumab vs. placebo, or to confirm whether the events were infectious, allergic or idiopathic. Data on specific clinical features of ocular AEs were not collected in these trials, and inconsistencies in how MedDRA PTs were assigned limit the utility of comparison of conjunctivitis PTs between dupilumab and placebo. Case reports have described common features of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients from clinical practice, including conjunctival redness, hyperaemia, blepharitis, dryness, irritation, discharge, itch, stinging, burning, tearing, foreign\u2010body sensation, occasional decrease in bilateral visual acuity and ectropion.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Further study into the clinical characteristics of conjunctivitis associated with dupilumab is warranted, and ongoing.The exact pathogenesis of conjunctivitis events observed during dupilumab treatment is unknown. Ocular comorbidities have high prevalence in patients with AD compared with the overall population.1, 2, 3, 4, 47 Thus, it is possible that pre\u2010existing ocular disorders and a dupilumab\u2013AD disease\u2010specific interaction may be responsible for this increased incidence in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD, particularly as conjunctivitis was not associated with dupilumab in trials in other type 2 diseases.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 Allergic conjunctivitis is a common comorbidity in asthma and allergic rhinitis, as well as in AD.1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 47, 48, 49 Both lesional and nonlesional skin in AD are characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction, including abnormalities in keratinocyte terminal differentiation, keratinocyte lipid production and tight junctions, which all contribute to increased transepidermal water loss.50, 51, 52 Ocular surface epithelia have impaired barrier function in patients with AD.53 Although barrier dysfunction is also observed in affected mucosal barrier tissues of other type 2 indications, patients with AD more frequently have ocular disease. If barrier abnormalities in AD differentially affect conjunctival tissues compared with other type 2 diseases, this could in part explain the differences in conjunctivitis incidence rates between AD trials and trials of other type 2 diseases.Several hypotheses have been proposed for mechanisms driving conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD, including alterations in cytokine activity leading to (variously) increased Demodex mites, increased OX40 ligand activity, eosinophilia, disruption of an immune\u2010mediated response of conjunctival\u2010associated lymphoid tissue, decreased IL\u201013\u2010related mucus production and decreased IL\u201013\u2010related scarcity of conjunctival goblet cells; it is possible that multiple mechanisms may be in effect.40, 43, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 In addition, different mechanisms may affect the development of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD vs. those with asthma or other type 2 diseases. Further investigation is needed, including collection of ocular samples, to characterize the molecular, cellular and inflammatory changes in the eye during these events, as well as during and after recovery or resolution.There are several limitations to this analysis. Firstly, there was no prespecified ocular assessment in these trials; patients were not examined by ophthalmologists at enrolment or during the trials. Thus, overall changes from baseline and/or objective differentiation of changes in ocular symptoms over time could not be determined. Secondly, conjunctivitis AEs were reported by the trial investigators (typically dermatologists or allergists). Patients were usually not referred to ophthalmologists, and few AEs reported as viral or bacterial conjunctivitis had microbiological confirmation. Nonetheless, within the limits of diagnostic accuracy of the investigators, the data show that dupilumab\u2010treated patients had higher rates of conjunctivitis. Thirdly, there are limitations related to classification of AEs by MedDRA. Lower\u2010level terms with higher specificity are very numerous (> 100), so the analysis had to be done at the PT level; for example, the lower\u2010level terms of \u2018blepharoconjunctivitis\u2019 would default to the PT of conjunctivitis. For the purpose of signal detection, it was necessary to cluster multiple PTs to avoid this fragmentation. In addition, during AE coding, the MedDRA PTs of \u2018conjunctivitis\u2019 and \u2018conjunctivitis allergic\u2019 were sometimes used interchangeably; therefore, these two terms should be considered equivalent. MedDRA coding of conjunctivitis AEs may result in classification of these events as either the MedDRA system organ class of \u2018eye disorders\u2019 or as \u2018infections and infestations\u2019, depending on the verbatim report of the investigator. Fourthly, history of conjunctivitis was self\u2010reported by patients, with likelihood of recall bias, as different symptoms from patients\u2019 history could be misinterpreted by the patients and/or investigators as conjunctivitis. Fifthly, the increasing incidence of conjunctivitis reported in the placebo groups of the different AD trials over time suggests that both an \u2018awareness bias\u2019 of the trial investigators in the later AD trials and a possible initial underdiagnosis of conjunctivitis in earlier trials may have influenced apparent increases in reported incidences of dupilumab\u2010associated conjunctivitis across studies over time. Finally, conclusions on the incidence of conjunctivitis in CRSwNP and EoE are limited by the small number of patients in the proof\u2010of\u2010concept trials included in this analysis.32, 33 These indications are still in development; future analyses will incorporate data from larger ongoing and future studies.In conclusion, the higher incidence of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD appears to be associated with several disease\u2010based factors, including baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis. Dupilumab treatment was not associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis in asthma, CRSwNP and EoE trials. In most cases, conjunctivitis AEs were mild to moderate. Most cases resolved or were resolving while patients continued their dupilumab treatment, but the data do not allow for determination of the proportion of patients who required continued or intermittent ongoing therapy for conjunctivitis. For timely appropriate intervention, we recommend referral for a detailed eye examination in patients who develop this complication while on dupilumab treatment. Further studies, including mechanistic investigations of ocular or conjunctival samples, are needed to characterize clinical phenotypes and understand the aetiology of the observed conjunctivitis AEs in the setting of dupilumab treatment, and to develop guidance for prevention and management.Supporting information Table S1 Randomized clinical trials of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and eosinophilic oesophagitis included in this analysis.

It is approved in the U.S.A", ". It is approved in the U.S.A. for patients aged \u2265 12 years with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe atopic dermatitis (AD) uncontrolled by topical prescription medicines or who cannot use topical medicines, for patients in Japan whose AD is uncontrolled with existing therapies, for patients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe AD in Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy and for patients aged \u2265 12 years for maintenance treatment of moderate\u2010to\u2010severe asthma uncontrolled with their current medicines. AD trials have reported increased incidence of conjunctivitis for dupilumab vs", ". AD trials have reported increased incidence of conjunctivitis for dupilumab vs. placebo.ObjectivesTo characterize further the occurrence and risk factors of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials.MethodsWe evaluated randomized placebo\u2010controlled trials of dupilumab in AD (n = 2629), asthma (n = 2876), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) (n = 60) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) (n = 47).ResultsIn most AD trials, dupilumab\u2010treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than placebo controls. Higher baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence. Conjunctivitis was mostly mild to moderate. Most cases recovered or resolved during the treatment period; two patients permanently discontinued dupilumab due to conjunctivitis or keratitis. Common treatments included ophthalmic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Most cases were diagnosed by the investigators", ". Most cases were diagnosed by the investigators. In asthma and CRSwNP trials, the incidence of conjunctivitis was lower for both dupilumab and placebo than in AD trials; dupilumab did not increase the incidence compared with placebo. In the EoE trial, no patients had conjunctivitis.ConclusionsConjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab treatment in most AD trials. In dupilumab trials in other type 2 diseases, incidence of conjunctivitis was overall very low, and was similar for dupilumab and placebo. In AD, the incidence of conjunctivitis was associated with AD severity and prior history of conjunctivitis. The aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients require further study", ". The aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients require further study. What's already known about this topic? Ocular disorders, including allergic conjunctivitis, are common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).In most dupilumab AD trials, dupilumab\u2010treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than those receiving placebo.Most cases were mild to moderate and recovered or were recovering during study treatment; study treatment discontinuation due to conjunctivitis was rare.Conjunctivitis incidence was very low and similar for dupilumab and placebo in clinical trials in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic oesophagitis", ". What does this study add? This analysis confirms and extends the results of the individual clinical trials.Baseline disease\u2010related factors, including AD severity, prior conjunctivitis history and certain biomarkers (thymus and activation\u2010regulated chemokine, IgE, eosinophils), were associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis.Patients who responded well to dupilumab had reduced incidence of conjunctivitis.Further study is needed to elucidate the aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD.

All cases of conjunctivitis were included regardless of aetiology (including blepharoconjunctivitis, which was coded as the MedDRA PT conjunctivitis; and excluding blepharitis in the absence of conjunctivitis).The study protocols did not require any specific query about ocular symptoms. AEs were generally reported by patients spontaneously, in response to the query \u2018did you have any problems?\u2019, or by investigators on physical examination during clinical visits. Investigators who reported conjunctivitis of unspecified aetiology were asked for more details, and whether they could use a more specific PT.

In most cases, the aetiology remained unspecified or was designated \u2018allergic\u2019 by the investigator. Investigators differed in how they categorized conjunctivitis to type, as there were no prespecified classification guidelines. Most cases reported as infectious (e.g. viral or bacterial) did not have laboratory confirmation of infectious aetiology. Most cases were not referred to ophthalmologists or other eye specialists.The impact of baseline demographic and disease characteristics; baseline serum levels of thymus and activation\u2010regulated chemokine (TARC; CCL17), IgE and blood eosinophil counts; and efficacy responses on conjunctivitis incidence rates were summarized for the monotherapy pool, CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9", ". We evaluated the relationship between dupilumab concentration and conjunctivitis in pooled data from SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS.Statistical analytical methodsThese analyses evaluated all patients who received at least one dose of study drug by treatment and dose regimen received. Incidence rates described proportions of patients with at least one conjunctivitis event, without modelling or censoring for patient withdrawal or rescue medication use. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated based on a Cox regression model (with censoring after patients\u2019 withdrawal), to describe the relative risk for time to first conjunctivitis event, comparing the dupilumab and placebo groups. Treatment groups were fixed effects and the analysis was stratified by study and baseline disease severity [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) = 3 vs. 4 for AD\u20101021, SOLO, CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9; or IGA = 0 vs. 1 vs. 2 for SOLO\u2010CONTINUE]", ". 4 for AD\u20101021, SOLO, CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9; or IGA = 0 vs. 1 vs. 2 for SOLO\u2010CONTINUE]. Medians, percentiles and 95% CIs were obtained from Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates.Relationships of baseline characteristics and treatment response with conjunctivitis incidence were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Results from post hoc analyses showing annualized rate ratios by various factors were extracted from a duration\u2010adjusted Poisson model.

S5; see Supporting Information), and nearly all patients recovered by the end of the treatment period (Table S5).DiscussionThis analysis confirmed that patients with AD treated with dupilumab had a greater incidence of conjunctivitis (8\u00b76\u201322\u00b71%) than placebo\u2010treated patients (2\u00b71\u201311\u00b71%) in most of the randomized, placebo\u2010controlled AD clinical trials included in this analysis, except for SOLO\u2010CONTINUE.23, 24, 25, 26, 36 This is consistent with the higher rates of external eye disorders, including conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, eye pruritus and dry eye, described for patients with AD in the dupilumab prescribing information.20, 21 Patients with AD were more likely to develop conjunctivitis if they had higher baseline AD severity, high levels of certain biomarkers or self\u2010reported history of conjunctivitis", ". By contrast, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trials of dupilumab in asthma, CRSwNP and EoE had low and similar incidence rates of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010 (0\u20131\u00b77%) and placebo\u2010treated (0\u20133\u00b73%) patients.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 In all trials, most cases of conjunctivitis were mild or moderate, and most resolved while continuing dupilumab treatment.Multiple factors (disease based and treatment based) are associated with incidence of conjunctivitis in these studies. Baseline AD severity and prior conjunctivitis history are most likely independent risk factors for conjunctivitis irrespectively of treatment, as incidence increases with baseline severity and prior history in placebo\u2010treated patients (as well as in dupilumab\u2010treated patients). CAF\u00c9, which had both the highest baseline level of AD severity and the highest rates of prior conjunctivitis history among all the AD trials, also had the highest rates of conjunctivitis", ". CAF\u00c9 was a later trial in this series, in which there might have been higher awareness of conjunctivitis as a potential AE. In contrast, conjunctivitis rates were lowest in SOLO\u2010CONTINUE, in which high\u2010level responders to dupilumab from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 were rerandomized to continued dupilumab treatment or placebo.Levels of certain biomarkers (TARC, IgE and eosinophils) increase with AD severity;22, 37, 38 thus, it is not surprising that both baseline AD severity and increased biomarker levels were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence in these studies. AD severity has been associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis,3, 8 and IgE levels are increased in patients with both AD and ocular complications.3, 4 High\u2010level efficacy responses (IGA 0/1, EASI 75) showed an apparent association with lower conjunctivitis incidence in dupilumab\u2010treated patients in the monotherapy pool; however, this trend was inconsistent or reversed in CHRONOS and CAF\u00c9", ". Fewer patients with severe AD at baseline achieved IGA 0/1 and EASI 75. Increased disease severity is associated with higher incidence of comorbidities and higher AD biomarkers, so these predictors may be interrelated.The pharmacokinetic data suggested, somewhat paradoxically, that lower dupilumab exposure might be associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis compared with higher dupilumab exposure. This finding would not be expected if there was a positive dose\u2013response relationship between dupilumab exposure and occurrence of conjunctivitis. Furthermore, 80% of cases resolved while continuing on dupilumab treatment. Thus, further study is warranted to understand better the underlying cause of the imbalance in events between treatment groups.Currently, there is no consensus on optimal approaches to prevent and manage conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients", ". Ophthalmic preparations of corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers were the most common treatments used for conjunctivitis in these trials. Case series and case reports have described several therapeutic approaches used successfully in clinical practice for treatment of conjunctivitis associated with dupilumab without discontinuation of dupilumab, including hyaluronic acid eyedrops, topical tacrolimus, TCS (e.g. fluorometholone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone), artificial tears, compounded oily ciclosporin eyedrops and antibiotic\u2013TCS combination therapies.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 As long\u2010term treatment with ophthalmic TCS can lead to more serious eye disorders such as cataracts and glaucoma, products with poor penetration into the anterior chamber of the eye (e.g. fluorometholone) should be considered", ". fluorometholone) should be considered. In addition, topical preparations of calcineurin inhibitors appear to be a reasonable long\u2010term therapeutic alternative.39 Patients who develop ocular symptoms during dupilumab treatment should receive full ophthalmic evaluations, and addition of an ophthalmologist to the patient management team may be of benefit.4, 39, 46 An important aspect of these analyses is that, based on existing data, and in the absence of ophthalmological or microbiological evaluation, it was not possible to identify events that were specific or pathognomonic for dupilumab vs. placebo, or to confirm whether the events were infectious, allergic or idiopathic. Data on specific clinical features of ocular AEs were not collected in these trials, and inconsistencies in how MedDRA PTs were assigned limit the utility of comparison of conjunctivitis PTs between dupilumab and placebo", ". Case reports have described common features of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients from clinical practice, including conjunctival redness, hyperaemia, blepharitis, dryness, irritation, discharge, itch, stinging, burning, tearing, foreign\u2010body sensation, occasional decrease in bilateral visual acuity and ectropion.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Further study into the clinical characteristics of conjunctivitis associated with dupilumab is warranted, and ongoing.The exact pathogenesis of conjunctivitis events observed during dupilumab treatment is unknown", ". Ocular comorbidities have high prevalence in patients with AD compared with the overall population.1, 2, 3, 4, 47 Thus, it is possible that pre\u2010existing ocular disorders and a dupilumab\u2013AD disease\u2010specific interaction may be responsible for this increased incidence in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD, particularly as conjunctivitis was not associated with dupilumab in trials in other type 2 diseases.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 Allergic conjunctivitis is a common comorbidity in asthma and allergic rhinitis, as well as in AD.1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 47, 48, 49 Both lesional and nonlesional skin in AD are characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction, including abnormalities in keratinocyte terminal differentiation, keratinocyte lipid production and tight junctions, which all contribute to increased transepidermal water loss.50, 51, 52 Ocular surface epithelia have impaired barrier function in patients with AD.53 Although barrier dysfunction is also observed in", "impaired barrier function in patients with AD.53 Although barrier dysfunction is also observed in affected mucosal barrier tissues of other type 2 indications, patients with AD more frequently have ocular disease", ". If barrier abnormalities in AD differentially affect conjunctival tissues compared with other type 2 diseases, this could in part explain the differences in conjunctivitis incidence rates between AD trials and trials of other type 2 diseases.Several hypotheses have been proposed for mechanisms driving conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD, including alterations in cytokine activity leading to (variously) increased Demodex mites, increased OX40 ligand activity, eosinophilia, disruption of an immune\u2010mediated response of conjunctival\u2010associated lymphoid tissue, decreased IL\u201013\u2010related mucus production and decreased IL\u201013\u2010related scarcity of conjunctival goblet cells; it is possible that multiple mechanisms may be in effect.40, 43, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 In addition, different mechanisms may affect the development of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD vs. those with asthma or other type 2 diseases", ". those with asthma or other type 2 diseases. Further investigation is needed, including collection of ocular samples, to characterize the molecular, cellular and inflammatory changes in the eye during these events, as well as during and after recovery or resolution.There are several limitations to this analysis. Firstly, there was no prespecified ocular assessment in these trials; patients were not examined by ophthalmologists at enrolment or during the trials. Thus, overall changes from baseline and/or objective differentiation of changes in ocular symptoms over time could not be determined. Secondly, conjunctivitis AEs were reported by the trial investigators (typically dermatologists or allergists). Patients were usually not referred to ophthalmologists, and few AEs reported as viral or bacterial conjunctivitis had microbiological confirmation", ". Nonetheless, within the limits of diagnostic accuracy of the investigators, the data show that dupilumab\u2010treated patients had higher rates of conjunctivitis. Thirdly, there are limitations related to classification of AEs by MedDRA. Lower\u2010level terms with higher specificity are very numerous (> 100), so the analysis had to be done at the PT level; for example, the lower\u2010level terms of \u2018blepharoconjunctivitis\u2019 would default to the PT of conjunctivitis. For the purpose of signal detection, it was necessary to cluster multiple PTs to avoid this fragmentation. In addition, during AE coding, the MedDRA PTs of \u2018conjunctivitis\u2019 and \u2018conjunctivitis allergic\u2019 were sometimes used interchangeably; therefore, these two terms should be considered equivalent. MedDRA coding of conjunctivitis AEs may result in classification of these events as either the MedDRA system organ class of \u2018eye disorders\u2019 or as \u2018infections and infestations\u2019, depending on the verbatim report of the investigator", ". Fourthly, history of conjunctivitis was self\u2010reported by patients, with likelihood of recall bias, as different symptoms from patients\u2019 history could be misinterpreted by the patients and/or investigators as conjunctivitis. Fifthly, the increasing incidence of conjunctivitis reported in the placebo groups of the different AD trials over time suggests that both an \u2018awareness bias\u2019 of the trial investigators in the later AD trials and a possible initial underdiagnosis of conjunctivitis in earlier trials may have influenced apparent increases in reported incidences of dupilumab\u2010associated conjunctivitis across studies over time", ". Finally, conclusions on the incidence of conjunctivitis in CRSwNP and EoE are limited by the small number of patients in the proof\u2010of\u2010concept trials included in this analysis.32, 33 These indications are still in development; future analyses will incorporate data from larger ongoing and future studies.In conclusion, the higher incidence of conjunctivitis in dupilumab\u2010treated patients with AD appears to be associated with several disease\u2010based factors, including baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis. Dupilumab treatment was not associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis in asthma, CRSwNP and EoE trials. In most cases, conjunctivitis AEs were mild to moderate. Most cases resolved or were resolving while patients continued their dupilumab treatment, but the data do not allow for determination of the proportion of patients who required continued or intermittent ongoing therapy for conjunctivitis", ". For timely appropriate intervention, we recommend referral for a detailed eye examination in patients who develop this complication while on dupilumab treatment. Further studies, including mechanistic investigations of ocular or conjunctival samples, are needed to characterize clinical phenotypes and understand the aetiology of the observed conjunctivitis AEs in the setting of dupilumab treatment, and to develop guidance for prevention and management.Supporting information Table S1 Randomized clinical trials of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and eosinophilic oesophagitis included in this analysis.
