For instance, the hashtags #1918flu and #outbreak might imply that the current flu season or pandemic is comparable to the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which was a global outbreak with high mortality rates.

In fact, the article doesn't mention testing for either the vaccine-strain or the wild strain at all. This is concerning because 96% (n=323) of studies on measles vaccination report outcomes related to immunity, and only a small percentage (9%, n=32) report production metrics. It's likely that more context is needed to fully evaluate this claim, but based on what we know, it seems like an unsubstantiated assumption.",0.8152426481246948,0.697988748550415,0.7520729899406433
